 * 3. StatsDelegate: It is possible to receive statistics about ongoing
 * operation by defining a StatsDelegate or by calling
 * getLastReceivedStats method.
 *
 * 4. Font configuration: It is possible to register custom fonts with
 * setFontconfigConfigurationPath: and
 * setFontDirectory:with: methods.

LADSPA SDK
----------

The API itself can be be found in src/ladspa.h. The rest of this
package is a software development kit to make the API even easier to
work with.

See http://www.ladspa.org for news and updates to the API and SDK. See
http://www.ladspa.org/cmt for a basic plugin library. The latter is
GPL'd and contains `full' versions of all the plugins contained in the
example libraries.

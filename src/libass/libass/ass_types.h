/**
 * Support for (xy-)vsfilter mangled colors
 *
 * Generally, xy-vsfilter emulates the classic vsfilter behavior of
 * rendering directly into the (usually YCbCr) video. vsfilter is
 * hardcoded to use BT.601(TV) as target colorspace when converting
 * the subtitle RGB color to the video colorspace. This led to major
 * breakage when HDTV video was introduced: HDTV typically uses
 * BT.709(TV), but vsfilter still used BT.601(TV) for conversion.
 *
 * This means classic vsfilter will mangle colors as follows:
 *
 *    screen_rgb = bt_709tv_to_rgb(rgb_to_bt601tv(ass_rgb))
 *
 * Or in general:
 *
 *    screen_rgb = video_csp_to_rgb(rgb_to_bt601tv(ass_rgb))
 *
 * where video_csp is the colorspace of the video with which the
 * subtitle was muxed.
 *
 * xy-vsfilter did not fix this, but instead introduced explicit
 * rules how colors were mangled by adding a "YCbCr Matrix" header.
 * If this header specifies a real colorspace (like BT.601(TV) etc.),
 * xy-vsfilter behaves exactly like vsfilter, but using the specified
 * colorspace for conversion of ASS input RGB to screen RGB:
 *
 *    screen_rgb = video_csp_to_rgb(rgb_to_ycbcr_header_csp(ass_rgb))
 *
 * Further, xy-vsfilter behaves like vsfilter with no changes if the header
 * is missing.
 *
 * The special value "None" means untouched RGB values. Keep in mind that
 * some version of xy-vsfilter are buggy and don't interpret this correctly.
 * It appears some people are advocating that this header value is
 * intended for situations where exact colors do not matter.
 *
 * Note that newer Aegisub versions (the main application to produce ASS
 * subtitle scripts) have an option that tries not to mangle the colors. It
 * is said that if the header is not set to BT.601(TV), the colors are
 * supposed not to be mangled, even if the "YCbCr Matrix" header is not
 * set to "None". In other words, the video colorspace as detected by
 * Aegisub is the same as identified in the file header.
 *
 * In general, misinterpreting this header or not using it will lead to
 * slightly different subtitle colors, which can matter if the subtitle
 * attempts to match solid colored areas in the video.
 *
 * Note that libass doesn't change colors based on this header. It
 * absolutely can't do that, because the video colorspace is required
 * in order to handle this as intended by xy-vsfilter.

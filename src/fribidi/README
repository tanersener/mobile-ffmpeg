# GNU FriBidi

The Free Implementation of the [Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm].


## Background

One of the missing links stopping the penetration of free software in Middle
East is the lack of support for the Arabic and Hebrew alphabets. In order to
have proper Arabic and Hebrew support, the bidi algorithm needs to be implemented. It is
our hope that this library will stimulate more free software in the Middle
Eastern countries.

See [`HISTORY`](./HISTORY) on how the project started and evolved.


## Audience

It is our hope that this library will stimulate the implementation of Hebrew and
Arabic support in lots of Free Software. Here is a small list of projects that
would benefit from the use of the GNU FriBidi library, but of course there are
many more: Wine, Mozilla, Qt, KDE, lynx, OpenOffice.

GNU FriBidi is already being used in projects like Pango (resulting in [GTK+] and
[GNOME] using GNU FriBidi), AbiWord, MLTerm, MPlayer, and BiCon.

See [`USERS`](./USERS) for a list of projects using GNU FriBidi.


## Dependencies

Currently GNU FriBidi does not depend on any other library, but uses Glib if
available. It uses GNU Build System for build and installation on POSIX systems.


## Downloading

The latest version of GNU FriBidi may be found at:
<https://github.com/fribidi/fribidi>


## Building

Start with running the [`bootstrap`](./bootstrap) script and follow the
instructions.

## Implementation

The library implements the algorithm described in the "Unicode Standard Annex
\#9, The Bidirectional Algorithm", available at
<http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr9/>.

The library uses Unicode (UTF-32) entirely. The character properties are
automatically extracted from the Unicode data files, available from
<http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/>. This means that every Unicode
character is treated in strict accordance with the Unicode specification.

There is a limited support for character set conversion from/to the UTF-32
encoding. Data in these character sets must be converted into UTF-32 before the
library may be used. iconv(3) can always do a better job on that, so you may
find that the character sets conversion code is typically turned off on POSIX
machines.


### Conformance Status

GNU Fribidi has been tested exhaustively against the [Unicode Reference Code],
and to the best of our knowledge, it completely conforms to the specification,
always producing the same result as the Reference Code.


### API

The simplest way of accessing the API is through the convenience function `fribibidi_log2vis` which has the following signature:

```c
fribidi_boolean fribidi_log2vis(
    /* input */
    FriBidiChar     *str,
    FriBidiStrIndex len,
    FriBidiCharType *pbase_dir,
    /* output */
    FriBidiChar     *visual_str,
    FriBidiStrIndex *position_L_to_V_list,
    FriBidiStrIndex *position_V_to_L_list,
    FriBidiLevel    *embedding_level_list
)
```

Where...

* `str` is the Unicode input string.
* `len` is the length of the Unicode string (`str`).
* `pbase_dir` is the input and output base direction. If `pbase_dir ==
  FRIBIDI_TYPE_ON` then `fribidi_log2vis()` calculates the base direction on its
  own, according to the bidi algorithm.
* `visual_str` is the reordered output unicode string.
* `position_L_to_V_list` maps the positions in the logical string to positions
  in the visual string.
* `position_V_to_L_list` maps the positions in the visual string to the
  positions in the logical string.
* `embedding_level_list` returns the classification of each character. Here,
  even numerical levels indicate LTR characters, and odd levels indicate RTL
  characters. The main use of this list is in interactive applications where,
  for example, the embedding level determines cursor display.

If any of the output pointers is equal to `NULL`, then that information is not
calculated.

Note that a call to `fribidi_log2vis()` is a convenience function to calling the following three functions in order:

1. `fribidi_get_bidi_types()`
2. `fribidi_get_par_embedding_levels_ex()`
3. `fribidi_reorder_line()`

## How it looks like

Have a look at [`test/`](./test) directory, to see some input and outputs.

The `CapRTL` charset means that CAPITAL letters are right to left, and digits
6, 7, 8, 9 are Arabic digits, try 'fribidi --charsetdesc CapRTL' for the full
description.


## Executable

There is also a command-line utilitity called `fribidi` that loops over the text
of a file and performs the bidi algorithm on each line, also used for testing
the algorithm.

Run `fribidi --help` to learn about usage.

The command-line utility is known to have problems with line-breaking and
logical-to-vertical/vertical-to-logical lists.

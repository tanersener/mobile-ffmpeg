* Version 3.6.11 (released 2019-12-01)

** libgnutls: Use KERN_ARND for the system random number generator on NetBSD.
   This syscall provides an endless stream of random numbers from the kernel's
   ChaCha20-based random number generator, without blocking or requiring an open file
   descriptor.

** libgnutls: Corrected issue with TLS 1.2 session ticket handling as client
   during resumption (#841).

** libgnutls: gnutls_base64_decode2() succeeds decoding the empty string to
   the empty string. This is a behavioral change of the API but it conforms
   to the RFC4648 expectations (#834).

** libgnutls: Fixed AES-CFB8 implementation, when input is shorter than
   the block size. Fix backported from nettle.

** certtool: CRL distribution points will be set in CA certificates even when
   non self-signed (#765).

** gnutls-cli/serv: added raw public-key handling capabilities (RFC7250).
   Key material can be set via the --rawpkkeyfile and --rawpkfile flags.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.


* Version 3.6.10 (released 2019-09-29)

** libgnutls: Added support for deterministic ECDSA/DSA (RFC6979)
   Deterministic signing can be enabled by setting
   GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_FLAG_REPRODUCIBLE when calling gnutls_privkey_sign_*()
   functions (#94).

** libgnutls: add gnutls_aead_cipher_encryptv2 and gnutls_aead_cipher_decryptv2
   functions that will perform in-place encryption/decryption on data buffers (#718).

** libgnutls: Corrected issue in gnutls_session_get_data2() which could fail under
   TLS1.3, if a timeout callback was not set using gnutls_transport_set_pull_timeout_function()
   (#823).

** libgnutls: added interoperability tests with gnutls 2.12.x; addressed
   issue with large record handling due to random padding (#811).

** libgnutls: the server now selects the highest TLS protocol version,
   if TLS 1.3 is enabled and the client advertises an older protocol version first (#837).

** libgnutls: fix non-PIC assembly on i386 (#818).

** libgnutls: added support for GOST 28147-89 cipher in CNT (GOST counter) mode
   and MAC generation based on GOST 28147-89 (IMIT). For description of the
   modes see RFC 5830. S-Box is id-tc26-gost-28147-param-Z (TC26Z) defined in
   RFC 7836.

** certtool: when outputting an encrypted private key do not insert the textual description
   of it. This fixes a regression since 3.6.5 (#840).

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_aead_cipher_encryptv2: Added
gnutls_aead_cipher_decryptv2: Added
GNUTLS_CIPHER_GOST28147_TC26Z_CNT: Added
GNUTLS_MAC_GOST28147_TC26Z_IMIT: Added

* Version 3.6.9 (released 2019-07-25)

** libgnutls: add gnutls_hash_copy/gnutls_hmac_copy functions that will create a copy
   of digest or MAC context. Copying contexts for externally-registered digest and MAC
   contexts is unupported (#787).

** Marked the crypto implementation override APIs as deprecated. These APIs are rarely
   used, are for a niche use case, but have significant side effects, such as preventing
   any internal re-organization and extension of the internal cipher API. The APIs remain
   functional though a compiler warning will be issued, and a future minor version update
   may transform them to a no-op while keeping ABI compatibility (#789).

** libgnutls: Added support for AES-GMAC, as a separate to GCM, MAC algorithm (#781).

** libgnutls: gnutls_privkey_sign_hash2 now accepts the GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_SIGN_FLAG_TLS1_RSA
   flag as documented. This makes it a complete replacement of gnutls_privkey_sign_hash().

** libgnutls: Added support for Generalname registeredID.

** The priority configuration was enhanced to allow more elaborate
   system-wide configuration of the library (#587).
   The following changes were included:
    - The file is read as an ini file with '#' indicating a comment.
    - The section "[priorities]" or global follows the existing semantics of
      the configuration file, and allows to specify system-wide priority strings
      which are accessed with the '@' prefix.
    - The section "[overrides]" is added with the parameters "insecure-hash",
      "insecure-sig", "insecure-sig-for-cert", "disabled-curve",
      "disabled-version", "min-verification-profile", "tls-disabled-cipher",
      "tls-disabled-mac", "tls-disabled-group", "tls-disabled-kx", which prohibit
      specific algorithms or options globally. Existing algorithms in the
      library can be marked as disabled and insecure, but no hard-coded
      insecure algorithm can be marked as secure (so that the configuration
      cannot be abused to make the system vulnerable).
    - Unknown sections or options are skipped with a debug message, unless
      the GNUTLS_SYSTEM_PRIORITY_FAIL_ON_INVALID environment parameter is
      set to 1.

** libgnutls: Added new flag for GNUTLS_CPUID_OVERRIDE
    - 0x20: Enable SHA_NI instruction set

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_crypto_register_cipher: Deprecated
gnutls_crypto_register_aead_cipher: Deprecated
gnutls_crypto_register_digest: Deprecated
gnutls_crypto_register_mac: Deprecated
gnutls_get_system_config_file: Added
gnutls_hash_copy: Added
gnutls_hmac_copy: Added
GNUTLS_MAC_AES_GMAC_128: Added
GNUTLS_MAC_AES_GMAC_192: Added
GNUTLS_MAC_AES_CMAC_256: Added
GNUTLS_SAN_REGISTERED_ID: Added


* Version 3.6.8 (released 2019-05-28)

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_prf_early() function to retrieve early keying
   material (#329)

** libgnutls: Added support for AES-XTS cipher (#354)

** libgnutls: Fix calculation of Streebog digests (incorrect carry operation in
   512 bit addition)

** libgnutls: During Diffie-Hellman operations in TLS, verify that the peer's
   public key is on the right subgroup (y^q=1 mod p), when q is available (under
   TLS 1.3 and under earlier versions when RFC7919 parameters are used).

** libgnutls: the gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_function can now be used
   with the 8192 parameters as well (#995).

** libgnutls: Fixed bug preventing the use of gnutls_pubkey_verify_data2() and
   gnutls_pubkey_verify_hash2() with the GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_CA_SIGN flag (#754)

** libgnutls: The priority string option %ALLOW_SMALL_RECORDS was added to allow
   clients to communicate with the server advertising smaller limits than 512

** libgnutls: Apply STD3 ASCII rules in gnutls_idna_map() to prevent
   hostname/domain crafting via IDNA conversion (#720)

** certtool: allow the digital signature key usage flag in CA certificates.
   Previously certtool would ignore this flag for CA certificates even if
   specified (#767)

** gnutls-cli/serv: added the --keymatexport and --keymatexportsize options.
   These allow testing the RFC5705 using these tools.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_prf_early: Added
gnutls_record_set_max_recv_size: Added
gnutls_dh_params_import_raw3: Added
gnutls_ffdhe_2048_group_q: Added
gnutls_ffdhe_3072_group_q: Added
gnutls_ffdhe_4096_group_q: Added
gnutls_ffdhe_6144_group_q: Added
gnutls_ffdhe_8192_group_q: Added


* Version 3.6.7 (released 2019-03-27)

** libgnutls, gnutls tools: Every gnutls_free() will automatically set
   the free'd pointer to NULL. This prevents possible use-after-free and
   double free issues. Use-after-free will be turned into NULL dereference.
   The counter-measure does not extend to applications using gnutls_free().

** libgnutls: Fixed a memory corruption (double free) vulnerability in the
   certificate verification API. Reported by Tavis Ormandy; addressed with
   the change above. [GNUTLS-SA-2019-03-27, #694]

** libgnutls: Fixed an invalid pointer access via malformed TLS1.3 async messages;
   Found using tlsfuzzer. [GNUTLS-SA-2019-03-27, #704]

** libgnutls: enforce key usage limitations on certificates more actively.
   Previously we would enforce it for TLS1.2 protocol, now we enforce it
   even when TLS1.3 is negotiated, or on client certificates as well. When
   an inappropriate for TLS1.3 certificate is seen on the credentials structure
   GnuTLS will disable TLS1.3 support for that session (#690).

** libgnutls: the default number of tickets sent under TLS 1.3 was increased to
   two. This makes it easier for clients which perform multiple connections
   to the server to use the tickets sent by a default server.

** libgnutls: enforce the equality of the two signature parameters fields in
   a certificate. We were already enforcing the signature algorithm, but there
   was a bug in parameter checking code.

** libgnutls: fixed issue preventing sending and receiving from different
   threads when false start was enabled (#713).

** libgnutls: the flag GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_LOGIN_SO now implies a writable
   session, as non-writeable security officer sessions are undefined in PKCS#11
   (#721).

** libgnutls: no longer send downgrade sentinel in TLS 1.3.
   Previously the sentinel value was embedded to early in version
   negotiation and was sent even on TLS 1.3. It is now sent only when
   TLS 1.2 or earlier is negotiated (#689).

** gnutls-cli: Added option --logfile to redirect informational messages output.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.


* Version 3.6.6 (released 2019-01-25)

** libgnutls: gnutls_pubkey_import_ecc_raw() was fixed to set the number bits
   on the public key (#640).

** libgnutls: Added support for raw public-key authentication as defined in RFC7250.
   Raw public-keys can be negotiated by enabling the corresponding certificate
   types via the priority strings. The raw public-key mechanism must be explicitly
   enabled via the GNUTLS_ENABLE_RAWPK init flag (#26, #280).

** libgnutls: When on server or client side we are sending no extensions we do
   not set an empty extensions field but we rather remove that field competely.
   This solves a regression since 3.5.x and improves compatibility of the server
   side with certain clients.

** libgnutls: We no longer mark RSA keys in PKCS#11 tokens as RSA-PSS capable if
   the CKA_SIGN is not set (#667).

** libgnutls: The priority string option %NO_EXTENSIONS was improved to completely
   disable extensions at all cases, while providing a functional session. This
   also implies that when specified, TLS1.3 is disabled.

** libgnutls: GNUTLS_X509_NO_WELL_DEFINED_EXPIRATION was marked as deprecated.
   The previous definition was non-functional (#609).

** API and ABI modifications:
GNUTLS_ENABLE_RAWPK: Added
GNUTLS_ENABLE_CERT_TYPE_NEG: Removed (was no-op; replaced by GNUTLS_ENABLE_RAWPK) 
GNUTLS_X509_NO_WELL_DEFINED_EXPIRATION: Deprecated
GNUTLS_PCERT_NO_CERT: Deprecated


* Version 3.6.5 (released 2018-12-01)

** libgnutls: Provide the option of transparent re-handshake/reauthentication
   when the GNUTLS_AUTO_REAUTH flag is specified in gnutls_init() (#571).

** libgnutls: Added support for TLS 1.3 zero round-trip (0-RTT) mode (#127)

** libgnutls: The priority functions will ignore and not enable TLS1.3 if
   requested with legacy TLS versions enabled but not TLS1.2. That is because
   if such a priority string is used in the client side (e.g., TLS1.3+TLS1.0 enabled)
   servers which do not support TLS1.3 will negotiate TLS1.2 which will be
   rejected by the client as disabled (#621).

** libgnutls: Change RSA decryption to use a new side-channel silent function.
   This addresses a security issue where memory access patterns as well as timing
   on the underlying Nettle rsa-decrypt function could lead to new Bleichenbacher
   attacks. Side-channel resistant code is slower due to the need to mask
   access and timings. When used in TLS the new functions cause RSA based
   handshakes to be between 13% and 28% slower on average (Numbers are indicative,
   the tests where performed on a relatively modern Intel CPU, results vary
   depending on the CPU and architecture used). This change makes nettle 3.4.1
   the minimum requirement of gnutls (#630). [CVSS: medium]

** libgnutls: gnutls_priority_init() and friends, allow the CTYPE-OPENPGP keyword
   in the priority string. It is only accepted as legacy option and is ignored.

** libgnutls: Added support for EdDSA under PKCS#11 (#417)

** libgnutls: Added support for AES-CFB8 cipher (#357)

** libgnutls: Added support for AES-CMAC MAC (#351)

** libgnutls: In two previous versions GNUTLS_CIPHER_GOST28147_CPB/CPC/CPD_CFB ciphers
   have incorrectly used CryptoPro-A S-BOX instead of proper (CryptoPro-B/-C/-D
   S-BOXes). They are fixed now.

** libgnutls: Added support for GOST key unmasking and unwrapped GOST private
   keys parsing, as specified in R 50.1.112-2016.

** gnutls-serv: It applies the default settings when no --priority option is given,
   using gnutls_set_default_priority().

** p11tool: Fix initialization of security officer's PIN with the --initialize-so-pin
   option (#561)

** certtool: Add parameter --no-text that prevents certtool from outputting
   text before PEM-encoded private key, public key, certificate, CRL or CSR.

** API and ABI modifications:
GNUTLS_AUTO_REAUTH: Added
GNUTLS_CIPHER_AES_128_CFB8: Added
GNUTLS_CIPHER_AES_192_CFB8: Added
GNUTLS_CIPHER_AES_256_CFB8: Added
GNUTLS_MAC_AES_CMAC_128: Added
GNUTLS_MAC_AES_CMAC_256: Added
gnutls_record_get_max_early_data_size: Added
gnutls_record_send_early_data: Added
gnutls_record_recv_early_data: Added
gnutls_db_check_entry_expire_time: Added
gnutls_anti_replay_set_add_function: Added
gnutls_anti_replay_init: Added
gnutls_anti_replay_deinit: Added
gnutls_anti_replay_set_window: Added
gnutls_anti_replay_enable: Added
gnutls_privkey_decrypt_data2: Added


* Version 3.6.4 (released 2018-09-24)

** libgnutls: Added the final (RFC8446) version numbering of the TLS1.3 protocol.

** libgnutls: Corrected regression since 3.6.3 in the callbacks set with
   gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function() which could not handle the case where
   no certificates were returned, or the callbacks were set to NULL (see #528).

** libgnutls: gnutls_handshake() on server returns early on handshake when no
   certificate is presented by client and the gnutls_init() flag GNUTLS_ENABLE_EARLY_START
   is specified.

** libgnutls: Added session ticket key rotation on server side with TOTP.
   The key set with gnutls_session_ticket_enable_server() is used as a
   master key to generate time-based keys for tickets. The rotation
   relates to the gnutls_db_set_cache_expiration() period.

** libgnutls: The 'record size limit' extension is added and preferred to the
   'max record size' extension when possible.

** libgnutls: Provide a more flexible PKCS#11 search of trust store certificates.
   This addresses the problem where the CA certificate doesn't have a subject key
   identifier whereas the end certificates have an authority key identifier (#569)

** libgnutls: gnutls_privkey_export_gost_raw2(), gnutls_privkey_import_gost_raw(),
   gnutls_pubkey_export_gost_raw2(), gnutls_pubkey_import_gost_raw() import
   and export GOST parameters in the "native" little endian format used for these
   curves. This is an intentional incompatible change with 3.6.3.

** libgnutls: Added support for seperately negotiating client and server certificate types
   as defined in RFC7250. This mechanism must be explicitly enabled via the
   GNUTLS_ENABLE_CERT_TYPE_NEG flag in gnutls_init().

** gnutls-cli: enable CRL validation on startup (#564)

** API and ABI modifications:
GNUTLS_ENABLE_EARLY_START: Added
GNUTLS_ENABLE_CERT_TYPE_NEG: Added
GNUTLS_TL_FAIL_ON_INVALID_CRL: Added
GNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_CRLS: Added
gnutls_ctype_target_t: New enumeration
gnutls_record_set_max_early_data_size: Added
gnutls_certificate_type_get2: Added
gnutls_priority_certificate_type_list2: Added
gnutls_ffdhe_6144_group_prime: Added
gnutls_ffdhe_6144_group_generator: Added
gnutls_ffdhe_6144_key_bits: Added


* Version 3.6.3 (released 2018-07-16)

** libgnutls: Introduced support for draft-ietf-tls-tls13-28. It includes version
   negotiation, post handshake authentication, length hiding, multiple OCSP support,
   consistent ciphersuite support across protocols, hello retry requests, ability
   to adjust key shares via gnutls_init() flags, certificate authorities extension,
   and key usage limits. TLS1.3 draft-28 support can be enabled by default if
   the option --enable-tls13-support is given to configure script.

** libgnutls: Apply compatibility settings for existing applications running with TLS1.2 or
   earlier and TLS 1.3. When SRP or NULL ciphersuites are specified in priority strings
   TLS 1.3 is will be disabled. When Anonymous ciphersuites are specified in priority
   strings, then TLS 1.3 negotiation will be disabled if the session is associated
   only with an anonymous credentials structure.

** Added support for Russian Public Key Infrastructure according to RFCs 4491/4357/7836.
   This adds support for using GOST keys for digital signatures and under PKCS#7, PKCS#12,
   and PKCS#8 standards. In particular added elliptic curves GOST R 34.10-2001 CryptoProA
   256-bit curve (RFC 4357), GOST R 34.10-2001 CryptoProXchA 256-bit curve (RFC 4357),
   and GOST R 34.10-2012 TC26-512-A 512-bit curve (RFC 7836).

** Provide a uniform cipher list across supported TLS protocols; the CAMELLIA ciphers
   as well as ciphers utilizing HMAC-SHA384 and SHA256 have been removed from the default
   priority strings, as they are undefined under TLS1.3 and they provide no advantage
   over other options in earlier protocols.

** The SSL 3.0 protocol is disabled on compile-time by default. It can be re-enabled
   by specifying --enable-ssl3-support on configure script.

** libgnutls: Introduced function to switch the current FIPS140-2 operational
   mode, i.e., strict vs a more lax mode which will allow certain non FIPS140-2
   operations.

** libgnutls: Introduced low-level function to assist applications attempting client
   hello extension parsing, prior to GnuTLS' parsing of the message.

** libgnutls: When exporting an X.509 certificate avoid re-encoding if there are no
   modifications to the certificate. That prevents DER re-encoding issues with incorrectly
   encoded certificates, or other DER incompatibilities to affect a TLS session.
   Relates with #403

** libgnutls: on group exchange honor the %SERVER_PRECEDENCE and select the groups
   which are preferred by the server. That unfortunately has complicated semantics
   as TLS1.2 requires specific ordering of the groups based on the ciphersuite ordering,
   which could make group order unpredictable if TLS1.3 is negotiated.

** Improved counter-measures for TLS CBC record padding. Kenny Paterson, Eyal Ronen
   and Adi Shamir reported that the existing counter-measures had certain issues and
   were insufficient when the attacker has additional access to the CPU cache and
   performs a chosen-plaintext attack. This affected the legacy CBC ciphersuites. [CVSS: medium]

** Introduced the %FORCE_ETM priority string option. This option prevents the negotiation
   of legacy CBC ciphersuites unless encrypt-then-mac is negotiated.

** libgnutls: gnutls_privkey_import_ext4() was enhanced with the
   GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_INFO_PK_ALGO_BITS flag.

** libgnutls: gnutls_pkcs11_copy_secret_key, gnutls_pkcs11_copy_x509_privkey2,
   gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_generate3 will mark objects as sensitive by default
   unless GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_MARK_NOT_SENSITIVE is specified. This is an API
   change for these functions which make them err towards safety.

** libgnutls: improved aarch64 cpu features detection by using getauxval().

** certtool: It is now possible to specify certificate and serial CRL numbers greater
   than 2**63-2 as a hex-encoded string both when prompted and in a template file.
   Default certificate serial numbers are now fully random. Default CRL
   numbers include more random bits and are larger than in previous GnuTLS versions.
   Since CRL numbers are required to be monotonic, specify suitable CRL numbers manually
   if you intend to later downgrade to previous versions as it was not possible
   to specify large CRL numbers in previous versions of certtool.

* Version 3.6.2 (released 2018-02-16)

** libgnutls: When verifying against a self signed certificate ignore issuer.
   That is, ignore issuer when checking the issuer's parameters strength, resolving
   issue #347 which caused self signed certificates to be additionally marked as of
   insufficient security level.

** libgnutls: Corrected MTU calculation for the CBC ciphersuites. The data
   MTU calculation now, it correctly accounts for the fixed overhead due to
   padding (as 1 byte), while at the same time considers the rest of the
   padding as part of data MTU.

** libgnutls: Address issue of loading of all PKCS#11 modules on startup
   on systems with a PKCS#11 trust store (as opposed to a file trust store).
   Introduced a multi-stage initialization which loads the trust modules, and
   other modules are deferred for the first pure PKCS#11 request.

** libgnutls: The SRP authentication will reject any parameters outside
   RFC5054. This protects any client from potential MitM due to insecure
   parameters. That also brings SRP in par with the RFC7919 changes to
   Diffie-Hellman.

** libgnutls: Added the 8192-bit parameters of SRP to the accepted parameters
   for SRP authentication.

** libgnutls: Addressed issue in the accelerated code affecting interoperability
   with versions of nettle >= 3.4.

** libgnutls: Addressed issue in the AES-GCM acceleration under aarch64.

** libgnutls: Addressed issue in the AES-CBC acceleration under ssse3 (patch by
   Vitezslav Cizek).

** srptool: the --create-conf option no longer includes 1024-bit parameters.

** p11tool: Fixed the deletion of objects in batch mode.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_srp_8192_group_generator: Added
gnutls_srp_8192_group_prime: Added


* Version 3.6.1 (released 2017-10-21)

** libgnutls: Fixed interoperability issue with openssl when safe renegotiation was
   used. Resolves gitlab issue #259.

** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_crl_sign, gnutls_x509_crt_sign,
   gnutls_x509_crq_sign, were modified to sign with a better algorithm than
   SHA1. They will now sign with an algorithm that corresponds to the security
   level of the signer's key.

** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_*_sign2() functions and gnutls_x509_*_privkey_sign()
   accept GNUTLS_DIG_UNKNOWN (0) as a hash function option. That will signal
   the function to auto-detect an appropriate hash algorithm to use.

** libgnutls: Removed support for signature algorithms using SHA2-224 in TLS.
   TLS 1.3 no longer uses SHA2-224 and it was never a widespread algorithm
   in TLS 1.2. As such, no reason to keep supporting it.

** libgnutls: Refuse to use client certificates containing disallowed
   algorithms for a session. That reverts a change on 3.5.5, which allowed
   a client to use DSA-SHA1 due to his old DSA certificate, without requiring him
   to enable DSA-SHA1 (and thus make it acceptable for the server's certificate).
   The previous approach was to allow a smooth move for client infrastructure
   after the DSA algorithm became disabled by default, and is no longer necessary
   as DSA is now being universally depracated.

** libgnutls: Refuse to resume a session which had a different SNI advertised. That
   improves RFC6066 support in server side. Reported by Thomas Klute.

** p11tool: Mark all generated objects as sensitive by default.

** p11tool: added options --sign-params and --hash. This allows testing
   signature with multiple algorithms, including RSA-PSS.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.


* Version 3.6.0 (released 2017-08-21)

** libgnutls: tlsfuzzer is part of the CI testsuite. This is a TLS testing and
   fuzzying toolkit, allowing for corner case testing, and ensuring that the
   behavior of the library will not change across releases.
   https://github.com/tomato42/tlsfuzzer

** libgnutls: Introduced a lock-free random generator which operates per-thread
   and eliminates random-generator related bottlenecks in multi-threaded operation.
   Resolves gitlab issue #141.
   http://nmav.gnutls.org/2017/03/improving-by-simplifying-gnutls-prng.html

** libgnutls: Replaced the Salsa20 random generator with one based on CHACHA.
   The goal is to reduce code needed in cache (CHACHA is also used for TLS),
   and the number of primitives used by the library. That does not affect the
   AES-DRBG random generator used in FIPS140-2 mode.

** libgnutls: Added support for RSA-PSS key type as well as signatures in
   certificates, and TLS key exchange. Contributed by Daiki Ueno.
   RSA-PSS signatures can be generated by RSA-PSS keys and normal RSA keys,
   but not vice-versa.  The feature includes:
     * RSA-PSS key generation and key handling (in PKCS#8 form)
     * RSA-PSS key generation and key handling from PKCS#11 (with CKM_RSA_PKCS_PSS mech)
     * Handling of RSA-PSS subjectPublicKeyInfo parameters, when present
       in either the private key or certificate.
     * RSA-PSS signing and verification of PKIX certificates
     * RSA-PSS signing and verification of TLS 1.2 handshake
     * RSA-PSS signing and verification of PKCS#7 structures
     * RSA-PSS and RSA key combinations for TLS credentials. That is, when
       multiple keys are supplied, RSA-PSS keys are preferred over RSA for RSA-PSS
       TLS signatures, to contain risks of cross-protocol attacks between the algorithms.
     * RSA-PSS key conversion to RSA PKCS#1 form (certtool --to-rsa)
   Note that RSA-PSS signatures with SHA1 are (intentionally) not supported.

** libgnutls: Added support for Ed25519 signing in certificates and TLS key
   exchange following draft-ietf-tls-rfc4492bis-17.  The feature includes:
     * Ed25519 key generation and key handling (in PKCS#8 form)
     * Ed25519 signing and verification of PKIX certificates
     * Ed25519 signing and verification of TLS 1.2 handshake
     * Ed25519 signing and verification of PKCS#7 structures

** libgnutls: Enabled X25519 key exchange by default, following draft-ietf-tls-rfc4492bis-17.

** libgnutls: Added support for Diffie-Hellman group negotiation following RFC7919.
   That makes the DH parameters negotiation more robust and less prone to errors
   due to insecure parameters. Servers are no longer required to specific explicit
   DH parameters, though if they do these parameters will be used. Group
   selection can be done via priority strings. The introduced strings are
   GROUP-ALL, GROUP-FFDHE2048, GROUP-FFDHE3072, GROUP-FFDHE4096 and
   GROUP-FFDHE8192, as well as the corresponding to curves groups. Note that
   the 6144 group from RFC7919 is not supported.

** libgnutls: Introduced various sanity checks on certificate import. Refuse
   to import certificates which have fractional seconds in Time fields, X.509v1
   certificates which have the unique identifiers set, and certificates with illegal
   version numbers. All of these are prohibited by RFC5280.

** libgnutls: Introduced gnutls_x509_crt_set_flags(). This function can set flags
   in the crt structure. The only flag supported at the moment is
   GNUTLS_X509_CRT_FLAG_IGNORE_SANITY which skips the certificate sanity
   checks on import.

** libgnutls: PKIX certificates with unknown critical extensions are rejected
   on verification with status GNUTLS_CERT_UNKNOWN_CRIT_EXTENSIONS. This
   behavior can be overridden by providing the flag GNUTLS_VERIFY_IGNORE_UNKNOWN_CRIT_EXTENSIONS
   to verification functions. Resolves gitlab issue #177.

** libgnutls: Refuse to generate a certificate with an illegal version, or an
   illegal serial number. That is, gnutls_x509_crt_set_version() and
   gnutls_x509_crt_set_serial(), will fail on input considered to be invalid
   in RFC5280.

** libgnutls: Calls to gnutls_record_send() and gnutls_record_recv()
   prior to handshake being complete are now refused. Addresses gitlab issue #158.

** libgnutls: Added support for PKCS#12 files with no salt (zero length) in their
   password encoding, and PKCS#12 files using SHA384 and SHA512 as MAC.

** libgnutls: Exported functions to encode and decode DSA and ECDSA r,s values.

** libgnutls: Added new callback setting function to gnutls_privkey_t for external
   keys. The new function (gnutls_privkey_import_ext4), allows signing in addition
   to previous algorithms (RSA PKCS#1 1.5, DSA, ECDSA), with RSA-PSS and Ed25519
   keys.

** libgnutls: Introduced the %VERIFY_ALLOW_BROKEN and %VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_WITH_SHA1
   priority string options. These allows enabling all broken and SHA1-based signature
   algorithms in certificate verification, respectively.

** libgnutls: 3DES-CBC is no longer included in the default priorities
   list. It has to be explicitly enabled, e.g., with a string like
   "NORMAL:+3DES-CBC".

** libgnutls: SHA1 was marked as insecure for signing certificates. Verification
   of certificates signed with SHA1 is now considered insecure and will
   fail, unless flags intended to enable broken algorithms are set. Other uses
   of SHA1 are still allowed. This can be reverted on compile time with the configure
   flag --enable-sha1-support.

** libgnutls: RIPEMD160 was marked as insecure for certificate signatures. Verification
   of certificates signed with RIPEMD160 hash algorithm is now considered insecure and
   will fail, unless flags intended to enable broken algorithms are set.

** libgnutls: No longer enable SECP192R1 and SECP224R1 by default on TLS handshakes.
   These curves were rarely used for that purpose, provide no advantage over
   x25519 and were deprecated by TLS 1.3.

** libgnutls: Removed support for DEFLATE, or any other compression method.

** libgnutls: OpenPGP authentication was removed; the resulting library is ABI
   compatible, with the openpgp related functions being stubs that fail
   on invocation.

** libgnutls: Removed support for libidn (i.e., IDNA2003); gnutls can now be compiled
   only with libidn2 which provides IDNA2008.

** certtool: The option '--load-ca-certificate' can now accept PKCS#11
   URLs in addition to files.

** certtool: The option '--load-crl' can now be used when generating PKCS#12
   files (i.e., in conjunction with '--to-p12' option).

** certtool: Keys with provable RSA and DSA parameters are now only read and
   exported from PKCS#8 form, following draft-mavrogiannopoulos-pkcs8-validated-parameters-00.txt.
   This removes support for the previous a non-standard key format.

** certtool: Added support for generating, printing and handling RSA-PSS and
   Ed25519 keys and certificates.

** certtool: the parameters --rsa, --dsa and --ecdsa to --generate-privkey are now
   deprecated, replaced by the --key-type option.

** p11tool: The --generate-rsa, --generate-ecc and --generate-dsa options were
   replaced by the --generate-privkey option.

** psktool: Generate 256-bit keys by default.

** gnutls-server: Increase request buffer size to 16kb, and added the --alpn and
   --alpn-fatal options, allowing testing of ALPN negotiation.

* Version 3.5.7 (released 2016-12-8)

** libgnutls: Include CHACHA20-POLY1305 ciphersuites in the SECURE128
   and SECURE256 priority strings.

** libgnutls: Require libtasn1 4.9; this ensures gnutls will correctly
   operate with OIDs which have elements that exceed 2^32.

** libgnutls: The DN decoding functions output the traditional DN format
   rather than the strict RFC4514 compliant textual DN. This reverts the
   3.5.6 introduced change, and allows applications which depended on the
   previous format to continue to function. Introduced new functions which
   output the strict format by default, and can revert to the old one using
   a flag.

** libgnutls: Improved TPM key handling. Check authorization requirements
   prior to using a key and fix issue on loop for PIN input. Patches by
   James Bottomley.

** libgnutls: In all functions accepting UTF-8 passwords, ensure that
   passwords are normalized according to RFC7613. When invalid UTF-8
   passwords are detected, they are only tolerated for decryption.
   This introduces a libunistring dependency on GnuTLS. A version of
   libunistring is included in the library for the platforms that do
   not ship it; it can be used with the '--with-included-unistring'
   option to configure script.

** libgnutls: When setting a subject alternative name in a certificate
   which is in UTF-8 format, it will transparently be converted to IDNA form
   prior to storing.

** libgnutls: GNUTLS_CRT_PRINT_ONELINE flag on gnutls_x509_crt_print()
   will print the SHA256 key-ID instead of a certificate fingerprint.

** libgnutls: enhance the PKCS#7 verification capabilities. In the case
   signers that are not discoverable using the trust list or input, use
   the stored list as pool to generate a trusted chain to the signer.

** libgnutls: Improved MTU calculation precision for the CBC ciphersuites
   under DTLS.

** libgnutls: [added missing news entry since 3.5.0]
   No longer tolerate certificate key usage violations for
   TLS signature verification, and decryption. That is GnuTLS will fail
   to connect to servers which incorrectly use a restricted to signing certificate
   for decryption, or vice-versa. This reverts the lax behavior introduced
   in 3.1.0, due to several such broken servers being available. The %COMPAT
   priority keyword can be used to work-around connecting on these servers.

** certtool: When exporting a CRQ in DER format ensure no text data are
   intermixed. Patch by Dmitry Eremin-Solenikov.

** certtool: Include the SHA-256 variant of key ID in --certificate-info
   options.

** p11tool: Introduced the --initialize-pin and --initialize-so-pin
   options.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_utf8_password_normalize: Added
gnutls_ocsp_resp_get_responder2: Added
gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_dn3: Added
gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn3: Added
gnutls_x509_rdn_get2: Added
gnutls_x509_dn_get_str2: Added
gnutls_x509_crl_get_issuer_dn3: Added
gnutls_x509_crq_get_dn3: Added


* Version 3.5.6 (released 2016-11-04)

** libgnutls: Enhanced the PKCS#7 parser to allow decoding old
   (pre-rfc5652) structures with arbitrary encapsulated content.

** libgnutls: Introduced a function group to set known DH parameters
   using groups from RFC7919.

** libgnutls: Added more strict RFC4514 textual DN encoding and decoding.
   Now the generated textual DN is in reverse order according to RFC4514,
   and functions which generate a DN from strings such gnutls_x509_crt_set_*dn()
   set the expected DN (reverse of the provided string).

** libgnutls: Introduced time and constraints checks in the end certificate
   in the gnutls_x509_crt_verify_data2() and gnutls_pkcs7_verify_direct()
   functions.

** libgnutls: Set limits on the maximum number of alerts handled. That is,
   applications using gnutls could be tricked into an busy loop if the
   peer sends continuously alert messages. Applications which set a maximum
   handshake time (via gnutls_handshake_set_timeout) will eventually recover
   but others may remain in a busy loops indefinitely. This is related but
   not identical to CVE-2016-8610, due to the difference in alert handling
   of the libraries (gnutls delegates that handling to applications).

** libgnutls: Reverted the change which made the gnutls_certificate_set_*key*
   functions return an index (introduced in 3.5.5), to avoid affecting programs
   which explicitly check success of the function as equality to zero. In order
   for these functions to return an index an explicit call to gnutls_certificate_set_flags
   with the GNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_API_V2 flag is now required.

** libgnutls: Reverted the behavior of sending a status request extension even
   without a response (introduced in 3.5.5). That is, we no longer reply to a
   client's hello with a status request, with a status request extension. Although
   that behavior is legal, it creates incompatibility issues with releases in
   the gnutls 3.3.x branch.

** libgnutls: Delayed the initialization of the random generator at
   the first call of gnutls_rnd(). This allows applications to load
   on systems which getrandom() would block, without blocking until
   real random data are needed.

** certtool: --get-dh-params will output parameters from the RFC7919
   groups.

** p11tool: improvements in --initialize option.

** API and ABI modifications:
GNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_API_V2: Added
GNUTLS_NO_TICKETS: Added
gnutls_pkcs7_get_embedded_data_oid: Added
gnutls_anon_set_server_known_dh_params: Added
gnutls_certificate_set_known_dh_params: Added
gnutls_psk_set_server_known_dh_params: Added
gnutls_x509_crt_check_key_purpose: Added


* Version 3.5.5 (released 2016-10-09)

** libgnutls: enhanced gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_file()
   to allow importing multiple OCSP request files, one for each chain
   provided.

** libgnutls: The gnutls_certificate_set_key* functions return an
   index of the added chain. That index can be used either with
   gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_file(), or with
   gnutls_certificate_get_crt_raw() and friends.

** libgnutls: Added SHA*, AES-GCM, AES-CCM and AES-CBC optimized implementations
   for the aarch64 architecture. Uses Andy Polyakov's assembly code.

** libgnutls: Ensure proper cleanups on gnutls_certificate_set_*key()
   failures due to key mismatch. This prevents leaks or double freeing
   on such failures.

** libgnutls: Increased the maximum size of the handshake message hash.
   This will allow the library to cope better with larger packets, as
   the ones offered by current TLS 1.3 drafts.

** libgnutls: Allow to use client certificates despite them containing
   disallowed algorithms for a session. That allows for example a client
   to use DSA-SHA1 due to his old DSA certificate, without requiring him
   to enable DSA-SHA1 (and thus make it acceptable for the server's certificate).

** libgnutls: Reverted AESNI code on x86 to earlier version as the
   latest version was creating position depending code. Added checks
   in the CI to detect position depending code early.

** guile: Update code to the I/O port API of Guile >= 2.1.4
   This makes sure the GnuTLS bindings will work with the forthcoming 2.2
   stable series of Guile, of which 2.1 is a preview.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_function2: Added
gnutls_session_ext_register: Added
gnutls_session_supplemental_register: Added
GNUTLS_E_PK_INVALID_PUBKEY: Added
GNUTLS_E_PK_INVALID_PRIVKEY: Added


* Version 3.5.4 (released 2016-09-08)

** libgnutls: Corrected the comparison of the serial size in OCSP response.
   Previously the OCSP certificate check wouldn't verify the serial length
   and could succeed in cases it shouldn't (GNUTLS-SA-2016-3).
   Reported by Stefan Buehler.

** libgnutls: Added support for IP name constraints. Patch by Martin Ukrop.

** libgnutls: Added support of PKCS#8 file decryption using DES-CBC-MD5. This
   is added to allow decryption of PKCS #8 private keys from openssl prior to 1.1.0.

** libgnutls: Added support for decrypting PKCS#8 files which use HMAC-SHA256
   as PRF. This allow decrypting PKCS #8 private keys generated with openssl 1.1.0.

** libgnutls: Added support for internationalized passwords in PKCS#12 files.
   Previous versions would only encrypt or decrypt using passwords from the ASCII
   set.

** libgnutls: Addressed issue with PKCS#11 signature generation on ECDSA
   keys. The signature is now written as unsigned integers into the DSASignatureValue
   structure. Previously signed integers could be written depending on what
   the underlying module would produce. Addresses #122.

** gnutls-cli: Fixed starttls regression from 3.5.3.

** API and ABI modifications:
GNUTLS_E_MALFORMED_CIDR: Added
gnutls_x509_cidr_to_rfc5280: Added
gnutls_oid_to_mac: Added


* Version 3.5.3 (released 2016-08-09)

** libgnutls: Added support for TCP fast open (RFC7413), allowing
   to reduce by one round-trip the handshake process. Based on proposal and
   patch by Tim Ruehsen.

** libgnutls: Adopted a simpler with less memory requirements DTLS sliding
   window implementation. Based on Fridolin Pokorny's implementation for
   AF_KTLS.

** libgnutls: Use getrandom where available via the syscall interface.
   This works around an issue of not-using getrandom even if it exists
   since glibc doesn't declare such function.

** libgnutls: Fixed DNS name constraints checking in the case of empty
   intersection of domain names in the chain. Report and fix by Martin Ukrop.

** libgnutls: Fixed name constraints checking in the case of chains
   where the higher level certificates contained different types of
   constraints than the ones present in the lower intermediate CAs.
   Report and fix by Martin Ukrop.

** libgnutls: Dropped support for the EGD random generator.

** libgnutls: Allow the decoding of raw elements (starting with #)
   in RFC4514 DN string decoding.

** libgnutls: Fixes in gnutls_x509_crt_list_import2, which was
   ignoring flags if all certificates in the list fit within the
   initially allocated memory. Patch by Tim Kosse.

** libgnutls: Corrected issue which made gnutls_certificate_get_x509_crt()
   to return invalid pointers when returned more than a single certificate.
   Report and fix by Stefan Sørensen.

** libgnutls: Fix gnutls_pkcs12_simple_parse to always extract the complete chain,
   even when the extra_certs was non-null. Report and fix by Stefan Sørensen.

** certtool: Added the "add_extension" and "add_critical_extension"
   template options. This allows specifying arbitrary extensions into
   certificates and certificate requests.

** gnutls-cli: Added the --fastopen option.

** API and ABI modifications:
GNUTLS_E_UNAVAILABLE_DURING_HANDSHAKE: Added
gnutls_x509_crq_set_extension_by_oid: Added
gnutls_x509_dn_set_str: Added
gnutls_transport_set_fastopen: Added


* Version 3.5.2 (released 2016-07-06)

** libgnutls: Address issue when utilizing the p11-kit trust store
   for certificate verification (GNUTLS-SA-2016-2).

** libgnutls: Fixed DTLS handshake packet reconstruction. Reported by
   Guillaume Roguez.

** libgnutls: Fixed issues with PKCS#11 reading of sensitive objects
   from SafeNet Network HSM. Reported by Anthony Alba in #108.

** libgnutls: Corrected the writing of PKCS#11 CKA_SERIAL_NUMBER. Report
   and fix by Stanislav Židek.

** libgnutls: Added AES-GCM optimizations using the AVX and MOVBE
   instructions. Uses Andy Polyakov's assembly code.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.


* Version 3.5.1 (released 2016-06-14)

** libgnutls: The SSL 3.0 protocol support can completely be removed
   using a compile time option. The configure option is --disable-ssl3-support.

** libgnutls: The SSL 2.0 client hello support can completely be removed
   using a compile time option. The configure option is --disable-ssl2-support.

** libgnutls: Added support for OCSP Must staple PKIX extension. That is,
   implemented the RFC7633 TLSFeature for OCSP status request extension.
   Feature implemented by Tim Kosse.

** libgnutls: More strict OCSP staple verification. That is, no longer
   ignore invalid or too old OCSP staples. The previous behavior was
   to rely on application use gnutls_ocsp_status_request_is_checked(),
   while the new behavior is to include OCSP verification by default
   and set the GNUTLS_CERT_INVALID_OCSP_STATUS verification flag on error.

** libgnutls: Treat CA certificates with the "Server Gated Cryptography" key
   purpose OIDs equivalent to having the GNUTLS_KP_TLS_WWW_SERVER OID. This
   improves interoperability with several old intermediate CA certificates
   carrying these legacy OIDs.

** libgnutls: Re-read the system wide priority file when needed. Patch by
   Daniel P. Berrange.

** libgnutls: Allow for fallback in system-specific initial keywords
   (prefixed with '@'). That allows to specify a keyword such as
   "@KEYWORD1,KEYWORD2" which will use the first available of these
   two keywords. Patch by Daniel P. Berrange.

** libgnutls: The SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable can be used to log
   session keys. These session keys are compatible with the NSS Key Log
   Format and can be used to decrypt the session for debugging using
   wireshark.

** API and ABI modifications:
GNUTLS_CERT_INVALID_OCSP_STATUS: Added
gnutls_x509_crt_set_crq_extension_by_oid: Added
gnutls_x509_ext_import_tlsfeatures: Added

* Version 3.5.0 (released 2016-05-09)

** libgnutls: Added SHA3 based signing algorithms for DSA, RSA and ECDSA,
   based on https://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/crypto_apps_infra/csor/algorithms.html

** libgnutls: Added support for curve X25519 (RFC 7748, draft-ietf-tls-rfc4492bis-07).
   This curve is disabled by default as it is still on specification status. It
   can be enabled using the priority string modifier +CURVE-X25519.

** libgnutls: Added support for TLS false start (draft-ietf-tls-falsestart-01)
   by introducing gnutls_init() flag GNUTLS_ENABLE_FALSE_START (#73).

** libgnutls: Added new APIs to access the FIPS186-4 (Shawe-Taylor based) provable
   RSA and DSA parameter generation from a seed.

** libgnutls: The CHACHA20-POLY1305 ciphersuite is enabled by default. This
   cipher is prioritized after AES-GCM.

** libgnutls: On a rehandshake ensure that the certificate of the peer or
   its username remains the same as in previous handshakes. That is to protect
   applications which do not check user credentials on rehandshakes. The
   threat to address depends on the application protocol. Primarily it
   protects against applications which authenticate the peer initially and
   perform accounting using the session's information, from being misled
   by a rehandshake which switches the peer's identity. Applications can
   disable this protection by using the %GNUTLS_ALLOW_ID_CHANGE flag in
   gnutls_init().

** libgnutls: No longer tolerate certificate key usage violations for
   TLS signature verification, and decryption. That is GnuTLS will fail
   to connect to servers which incorrectly use a restricted to signing certificate
   for decryption, or vice-versa. This reverts the lax behavior introduced
   in 3.1.0, due to several such broken servers being available. The %COMPAT
   priority keyword can be used to work-around connecting on these servers.

** libgnutls: Be strict in TLS extension decoding. That is, do not tolerate
   parsing errors in the extensions field and treat it as a typical Hello
   message structure. Reported by Hubert Kario (#40).

** libgnutls: Old and unsupported version numbers in client hellos are
   rejected with a "protocol_version" alert message. Reported by Hubert
   Kario (#42).

** libgnutls: Lifted the limitation of calling the gnutls_session_get_data*()
   functions, only on non-resumed sessions. This brings the API in par with
   its usage (#79).

** libgnutls: Follow RFC5280 strictly in name constraints computation. The
   permitted subtrees is intersected with any previous values. Report and
   patch by Daiki Ueno.

** libgnutls: Enforce the RFC 7627 (extended master secret) requirements on
   session resumption. Reported by Hubert Kario (#69).

** libgnutls: Consider the max-record TLS extension even when under DTLS.
   Reported by Peter Dettman (#61).

** libgnutls: Replaced writev() system call with sendmsg().

** libgnutls: Replaced select() system call with poll() on POSIX systems.

** libgnutls: Preload the system priority file on library load. This allows
   applications that chroot() to also use the system priorities.

** libgnutls: Applications are allowed to override the built-in key and
   certificate URLs.

** libgnutls: The gnutls.h header marks constant and pure functions explictly.

** certtool: Added the ability to sign certificates using SHA3.

** certtool: Added the --provable and --verify-allow-broken options.

** gnutls-cli: The --dane option will cause verification failure if gnutls is not
   compiled with DANE support.

** crywrap: The tool was unbundled from gnutls' distribution. It can be found at
   https://github.com/nmav/crywrap

** guile: .go files are now built and installed

** guile: Fix compatibility issue of the test suite with Guile 2.1

** guile: When --with-guile-site-dir is passed, modules are installed in a
   versioned directory, typically $(datadir)/guile/site/2.0

** guile: Tests no longer leave zombie processes behind

* Version 3.4.3 (released 2015-07-12)

** libgnutls: Follow closely RFC5280 recommendations and use UTCTime for
   dates prior to 2050.

** libgnutls: Force 16-byte alignment to all input to ciphers (previously it
   was done only when cryptodev was enabled).

** libgnutls: Removed support for pthread_atfork() as it has undefined
   semantics when used with dlopen(), and may lead to a crash.

** libgnutls: corrected failure when importing plain files
   with gnutls_x509_privkey_import2(), and a password was provided.

** libgnutls: Don't reject certificates if a CA has the URI or IP address
   name constraints, and the end certificate doesn't have an IP address
   name or a URI set.

** libgnutls: set and read the hint in DHE-PSK and ECDHE-PSK ciphersuites.

** p11tool: Added --list-token-urls option, and print the token module name
   in list-tokens.

** API and ABI modifications:

* Version 3.4.2 (released 2015-06-16)

** libgnutls: DTLS blocking API is more robust against infinite blocking,
and will notify of more possible timeouts.

** libgnutls: corrected regression with Camellia-256-GCM cipher. Reported
by Manuel Pegourie-Gonnard.

** libgnutls: Introduced the GNUTLS_NO_SIGNAL flag to gnutls_init(). That
allows to disable SIGPIPE for writes done within gnutls.

** libgnutls: Enhanced the PKCS #7 API to allow signing and verification
of structures. API moved to gnutls/pkcs7.h header.

** certtool: Added options to generate PKCS #7 bundles and signed
structures.

** API and ABI modifications:

* Version 3.4.1 (released 2015-05-03)

** libgnutls: gnutls_certificate_get_ours: will return the certificate even
if a callback was used to send it.

** libgnutls: Check for invalid length in the X.509 version field. Without
the check certificates with invalid length would be detected as having an
arbitrary version. Reported by Hanno Böck.

** libgnutls: Handle DNS name constraints with a leading dot. Patch by
Fotis Loukos.

** libgnutls: Updated system-keys support for windows to compile in more
versions of mingw. Patch by Tim Kosse.

** libgnutls: Fix for MD5 downgrade in TLS 1.2 signatures. Reported by
Karthikeyan Bhargavan [GNUTLS-SA-2015-2].

** libgnutls: Reverted: The gnutls_handshake() process will enforce a timeout
by default. That caused issues with non-blocking programs.

** certtool: It can generate SHA256 key IDs.

** gnutls-cli: fixed crash in --benchmark-ciphers. Reported by James Cloos.

** configure: re-enabled the --enable-local-libopts flag

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crt_get_pk_ecc_raw: Added


* Version 3.4.0 (released 2015-04-08)

** libgnutls: Added support for AES-CCM and AES-CCM-8 (RFC6655 and RFC7251)
ciphersuites. The former are enabled by default, the latter need to be
explicitly enabled, since they reduce the overall security level.

** libgnutls: Added support for Chacha20-Poly1305 ciphersuites following
draft-mavrogiannopoulos-chacha-tls-05 and draft-irtf-cfrg-chacha20-poly1305-10.
That is currently provided as technology preview and is not enabled by
default, since there are no assigned ciphersuite points by IETF and there
is no guarrantee of compatibility between draft versions. The ciphersuite
priority string to enable it is "+CHACHA20-POLY1305".

** libgnutls: Added support for encrypt-then-authenticate in CBC
ciphersuites (RFC7366 -taking into account its errata text). This is
enabled by default and can be disabled using the %NO_ETM priority
string.

** libgnutls: Added support for the extended master secret
(triple-handshake fix) following draft-ietf-tls-session-hash-02.

** libgnutls: Added a new simple and hard to misuse AEAD API (crypto.h).

** libgnutls: SSL 3.0 is no longer included in the default priorities
list. It has to be explicitly enabled, e.g., with a string like
"NORMAL:+VERS-SSL3.0".

** libgnutls: ARCFOUR (RC4) is no longer included in the default priorities
list. It has to be explicitly enabled, e.g., with a string like
"NORMAL:+ARCFOUR-128".

** libgnutls: DSA signatures and DHE-DSS are no longer included in the
default priorities list. They have to be explicitly enabled, e.g., with
a string like "NORMAL:+DHE-DSS:+SIGN-DSA-SHA256:+SIGN-DSA-SHA1". The
DSA ciphersuites were dropped because they had no deployment at all
on the internet, to justify their inclusion.

** libgnutls: The priority string EXPORT was completely removed. The string
was already defunc as support for the EXPORT ciphersuites was removed in
GnuTLS 3.2.0.

** libgnutls: Added API to utilize system specific private keys in
"gnutls/system-keys.h". It is currently provided as technology preview
and is restricted to windows CNG keys.

** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname() and friends will use
RFC6125 comparison of hostnames. That introduces a dependency on libidn.

** libgnutls: Depend on p11-kit 0.23.1 to comply with the final
PKCS #11 URLs draft (draft-pechanec-pkcs11uri-21).

** libgnutls: Depend on nettle 3.1.

** libgnutls: Use getrandom() or getentropy() when available. That
avoids the complexity of file descriptor handling and issues with
applications closing all open file descriptors on startup.

** libgnutls: Use pthread_atfork() to detect fork when available.

** libgnutls: If a key purpose (extended key usage) is specified for verification,
it is applied into intermediate certificates. The verification result
GNUTLS_CERT_PURPOSE_MISMATCH is also introduced.

** libgnutls: When gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file2() is used in
combination with PKCS #11, or TPM URLs, it will utilize the provided
password as PIN if required. That removes the requirement for the
application to set a callback for PINs in that case.

** libgnutls: priority strings VERS-TLS-ALL and VERS-DTLS-ALL are
restricted to the corresponding protocols only, and the VERS-ALL
string is introduced to catch all possible protocols.

** libgnutls: Added helper functions to obtain information on PKCS #8
structures.

** libgnutls: Certificate chains which are provided to gnutls_certificate_credentials_t
will automatically be sorted instead of failing with GNUTLS_E_CERTIFICATE_LIST_UNSORTED.

** libgnutls: Added functions to export and set the record state. That
allows for gnutls_record_send() and recv() to be offloaded (to kernel,
hardware or any other subsystem).

** libgnutls: Added the ability to register application specific URL
types, which express certificates and keys using gnutls_register_custom_url().

** libgnutls: Added API to override existing ciphers, digests and MACs, e.g.,
to override AES-GCM using a system-specific accelerator. That is, (crypto.h)
gnutls_crypto_register_cipher(), gnutls_crypto_register_aead_cipher(),
gnutls_crypto_register_mac(), and gnutls_crypto_register_digest().

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_ext_register() to register custom extensions.
Contributed by Thierry Quemerais.

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_supplemental_register() to register custom
supplemental data handshake messages. Contributed by Thierry Quemerais.

** libgnutls-openssl: it is no longer built by default.


** certtool: Added --p8-info option, which will print PKCS #8 information
even if the password is not available.

** certtool: --key-info option will print PKCS #8 encryption information
when available.

** certtool: Added the --key-id and --fingerprint options.

** certtool: Added the --verify-hostname, --verify-email and --verify-purpose
options to be used in certificate chain verification, to simulate verification
for specific hostname and key purpose (extended key usage).

** certtool: --p12-info option will print PKCS #12 MAC and cipher information
when available.

** certtool: it will print the A-label (ACE) names in addition to UTF-8.

** p11tool: added options --set-id and --set-label.

** gnutls-cli: added options --priority-list and --save-cert.

** guile: Deprecated priority API has been removed. The old priority API,
which had been deprecated for some time, is now gone; use 'set-session-priorities!'
instead.

** guile: Remove RSA parameters and related procedures. This API had been
deprecated.

** guile: Fix compilation on MinGW. Previously only the static version of the
'guile-gnutls-v-2' library would be built, preventing dynamic loading from Guile.

* Version 3.3.6 (released 2014-07-23)

** libgnutls: Use inet_ntop to print IP addresses when available

** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname and friends will also check
IP addresses, and match documented behavior. Reported by David Woodhouse.

** libgnutls: DSA key generation in FIPS140-2 mode doesn't allow 1024
bit parameters.

** libgnutls: fixed issue in gnutls_pkcs11_reinit() which prevented tokens
being usable after a reinitialization.

** libgnutls: fixed PKCS #11 private key operations after a fork.

** libgnutls: fixed PKCS #11 ECDSA key generation.

** libgnutls: The GNUTLS_CPUID_OVERRIDE environment variable can be used to
explicitly enable/disable the use of certain CPU capabilities. Note that CPU
detection cannot be overridden, i.e., VIA options cannot be enabled on an Intel
CPU. The currently available options are:
  0x1: Disable all run-time detected optimizations
  0x2: Enable AES-NI
  0x4: Enable SSSE3
  0x8: Enable PCLMUL
  0x100000: Enable VIA padlock
  0x200000: Enable VIA PHE
  0x400000: Enable VIA PHE SHA512

** libdane: added dane_query_to_raw_tlsa(); patch by Simon Arlott.

** p11tool: use GNUTLS_SO_PIN to read the security officer's PIN if set.

** p11tool: ask for label when one isn't provided.

** p11tool: added --batch parameter to disable any interactivity.

** p11tool: will not implicitly enable so-login for certain types of
objects. That avoids issues with tokens that require different login
types.

** certtool/p11tool: Added the --curve parameter which allows to explicitly
specify the curve to use.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_dir: Added
gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_trust_dir: Added


* Version 3.3.5 (released 2014-06-26)

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_record_recv_packet() and gnutls_packet_deinit().
These functions provide a variant of gnutls_record_recv() that avoids
the final memcpy of data.

** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_crl_iter_crt_serial() was added as a
faster variant of gnutls_x509_crl_get_crt_serial() when coping with
very large structures.

** libgnutls: When the decoding of a printable DN element fails, then treat
it as unknown and print its hex value rather than failing. That works around
an issue in a TURKTRST root certificate which improperly encodes the
X520countryName element.

** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_trust_file() will return the number
of certificates present in a PKCS #11 token when loading it.

** libgnutls: Allow the post client hello callback to put the handshake on
hold, by returning GNUTLS_E_AGAIN or GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED.

** certtool: option --to-p12 will now consider --load-ca-certificate

** certtol: Added option to specify the PKCS #12 friendly name on command
line.

** p11tool: Allow marking a certificate copied to a token as a CA.

** API and ABI modifications:
GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_MARK_CA: Added
gnutls_x509_crl_iter_deinit: Added
gnutls_x509_crl_iter_crt_serial: Added
gnutls_record_recv_packet: Added
gnutls_packet_deinit: Added
gnutls_packet_get: Added


* Version 3.3.4 (released 2014-05-31)

** libgnutls: Updated Andy Polyakov's assembly code. That prevents a
crash on certain CPUs.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.


* Version 3.3.3 (released 2014-05-30)

** libgnutls: Eliminated memory corruption issue in Server Hello parsing.
Issue reported by Joonas Kuorilehto of Codenomicon.

** libgnutls: gnutls_global_set_mutex() was modified to operate with the
new initialization process.

** libgnutls: Increased the maximum certificate size buffer
in the PKCS #11 subsystem.

** libgnutls: Check the return code of getpwuid_r() instead of relying
on the result value. That avoids issue in certain systems, when using
tofu authentication and the home path cannot be determined. Issue reported
by Viktor Dukhovni.

** libgnutls-dane: Improved dane_verify_session_crt(), which now attempts to
create a full chain. This addresses points from https://savannah.gnu.org/support/index.php?108552

** gnutls-cli: --dane will only check the end certificate if PKIX validation
has been disabled.

** gnutls-cli: --benchmark-soft-ciphers has been removed. That option cannot
be emulated with the implicit initialization of gnutls.

** certtool: Allow multiple organizations and organizational unit names to
be specified in a template.

** certtool: Warn when invalid configuration options are set to a template.

** ocsptool: Include path in ocsp request. This resolves #108582
(https://savannah.gnu.org/support/?108582), reported by Matt McCutchen.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_credentials_get: Added


* Version 3.3.2 (released 2014-05-06)

** libgnutls: Added the 'very weak' certificate verification profile
that corresponds to 64-bit security level.

** libgnutls: Corrected file descriptor leak on random generator
initialization.

** libgnutls: Corrected file descriptor leak on PSK password file
reading. Issue identified using the Codenomicon TLS test suite.

** libgnutls: Avoid deinitialization if initialization has failed.

** libgnutls: null-terminate othername alternative names.

** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_trust_list_get_issuer() will operate correctly
on a PKCS #11 trust list.

** libgnutls: Several small bug fixes identified using valgrind and
the Codenomicon TLS test suite.

** libgnutls-dane: Accept a certificate using DANE if there is at least one
entry that matches the certificate. Patch by simon [at] arlott.org.

** libgnutls-guile: Fixed compilation issue.

** certtool: Allow exporting a CRL on DER format.

** certtool: The ECDSA keys generated by default use the SECP256R1 curve
which is supported more widely than the previously used SECP224R1.

** API and ABI modifications:
GNUTLS_PROFILE_VERY_WEAK: Added


* Version 3.3.1 (released 2014-04-19)

** libgnutls: Enforce more strict checks to heartbeat messages
concerning padding and payload. Suggested by Peter Dettman.

** libgnutls: Allow decoding PKCS #8 files with ECC parameters
from openssl.

** libgnutls: Several small bug fixes found by coverity.

** libgnutls: The conditionally available self-test functions
were moved to self-test.h.

** libgnutls: Fixed issue with the check of incoming data when two
different recv and send pointers have been specified. Reported and
investigated by JMRecio.

** libgnutls: Fixed issue in the RSA-PSK key exchange, which would
result to illegal memory access if a server hint was provided. Reported
by André Klitzing.

** libgnutls: Fixed client memory leak in the PSK key exchange, if a
server hint was provided.

** libgnutls: Corrected the *get_*_othername_oid() functions.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.


* Version 3.3.0 (released 2014-04-10)

** libgnutls: The initialization of the library was moved to a
constructor. That is, gnutls_global_init() is no longer required
unless linking with a static library or a system that does not
support library constructors.

** libgnutls: static libraries are not built by default.

** libgnutls: PKCS #11 initialization is delayed to first usage.
That avoids long delays in gnutls initialization due to broken PKCS #11
modules.

** libgnutls: The PKCS #11 subsystem is re-initialized "automatically"
on the first PKCS #11 API call after a fork.

** libgnutls: certificate verification profiles were introduced
that can be specified as flags to verification functions. They
are enumerations in gnutls_certificate_verification_profiles_t
and can be converted to flags for use in a verification function
using GNUTLS_PROFILE_TO_VFLAGS().

** libgnutls: Added the ability to read system-specific initial
keywords, if they are prefixed with '@'. That allows a compile-time
specified configuration file to be used to read pre-configured priority
strings from. That can be used to impose system specific policies.

** libgnutls: Increased the default security level of priority
strings (NORMAL and PFS strings require at minimum a 1008 DH prime),
and set a verification profile by default.  The LEGACY keyword is
introduced to set the old defaults.

** libgnutls: Added support for the name constraints PKIX extension.
Currently only DNS names and e-mails are supported (no URIs, IPs
or DNs).

** libgnutls: Security parameter SEC_PARAM_NORMAL was renamed to
SEC_PARAM_MEDIUM to avoid confusion with the priority string NORMAL.

** libgnutls: Added new API in x509-ext.h to handle X.509 extensions.
This API handles the X.509 extensions in isolation, allowing to parse
similarly formatted extensions stored in other structures.

** libgnutls: When generating DSA keys the macro GNUTLS_SUBGROUP_TO_BITS
can be used to specify a particular subgroup as the number of bits in
gnutls_privkey_generate; e.g., GNUTLS_SUBGROUP_TO_BITS(2048, 256).

** libgnutls: DH parameter generation is now delegated to nettle.
That unfortunately has the side-effect that DH parameters longer than
3072 bits, cannot be generated (not without a nettle update).

** libgnutls: Separated nonce RNG from the main RNG. The nonce
random number generator is based on salsa20/12.

** libgnutls: The buffer alignment provided to crypto backend is
enforced to be 16-byte aligned, when compiled with cryptodev
support. That allows certain cryptodev drivers to operate more
efficiently.

** libgnutls: Return error when a public/private key pair that doesn't
match is set into a credentials structure.

** libgnutls: Depend on p11-kit 0.20.0 or later.

** libgnutls: The new padding (%NEW_PADDING) experimental TLS extension has
been removed. It was not approved by IETF.

** libgnutls: The experimental xssl library is removed from the gnutls
distribution.

** libgnutls: Reduced the number of gnulib modules used in the main library.

** libgnutls: Added priority string %DISABLE_WILDCARDS.

** libgnutls: Added the more extensible verification function
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers(), that allows checking, in addition
to a peer's DNS hostname, for the key purpose of the end certificate
(via PKIX extended key usage).

** certtool: Timestamps for serial numbers were increased to 8 bytes,
and in batch mode to 12 (appended with 4 random bytes).

** certtool: When no CRL number is provided (or value set to -1), then
a time-based number will be used, similarly to the serial generation
number in certificates.

** certtool: Print the SHA256 fingerprint of a certificate in addition
to SHA1.

** libgnutls: Added --enable-fips140-mode configuration option (unsupported).
That option enables (when running on FIPS140-enabled system):
 o RSA, DSA and DH key generation as in FIPS-186-4 (using provable primes)
 o The DRBG-CTR-AES256 deterministic random generator from SP800-90A.
 o Self-tests on initialization on ciphers/MACs, public key algorithms
   and the random generator.
 o HMAC-SHA256 verification of the library on load.
 o MD5 is included for TLS purposes but cannot be used by the high level
   hashing functions.
 o All ciphers except AES are disabled.
 o All MACs and hashes except GCM and SHA are disabled (e.g., HMAC-MD5).
 o All keys (temporal and long term) are zeroized after use.
 o Security levels are adjusted to the FIPS140-2 recommendations (rather
   than ECRYPT).

* Version 3.1.2 (released 2012-09-26)

** libgnutls: Fixed bug in gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_system_trust()
and gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_trust_mem() that prevented the loading
of certificates in the windows platform.

** libgnutls: Corrected bug in OpenPGP subpacket encoding.

** libgnutls: Added support for DTLS/TLS heartbeats by Olga Smolenchuk.
(the work was done during Google Summer of Code).

** libgnutls: Added X.509 certificate verification flag
GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_UNSORTED_CHAIN. This flag allows the verification
of unsorted certificate chains and is enabled by default for
TLS certificate verification (if gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags()
does not override it).

** libgnutls: Prints warning on certificates that contain keys of
an insecure level. If the %COMPAT priority flag is not specified
the TLS connection fails.

** libgnutls: Correctly restore gnutls_record_recv() in DTLS mode
if interrupted during the retrasmition of handshake data.

** libgnutls: Better mingw32 support (patch by LRN).

** libgnutls: The %COMPAT keyword, if specified, will tolerate
key usage violation errors (they are far too common to ignore).

** libgnutls: Added GNUTLS_STATELESS_COMPRESSION flag to gnutls_init(),
which provides a tool to counter compression-related attacks where
parts of the data are controlled by the attacker _and_ are placed in
separate records (use with care - do not use compression if not sure).

** libgnutls: Depends on libtasn1 2.14 or later.

** certtool: Prints the number of bits of the public key algorithm
parameter in a private key.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_privkey_get_pk_algorithm2: Added

GNUTLS_SEC_PARAM_INSECURE: Added

* Version 3.1.1 (released 2012-09-02)

** gnutls-serv: Listens on IPv6. Patch by Bernhard R. Link.

** certtool: Changes in password handling of certtool.
Ask password when required and only if the '--password' option is not
given. If the '--password' option is given during key generation then
assume the PKCS #8 file format, instead of ignoring the password.

** tpmtool: No longer asks for key password in registered keys.

** libgnutls: Elliptic curve code was optimized by Ilya Tumaykin.
wmNAF is now used for point multiplication and other optimizations.
(the major part of the work was done during Google Summer of Code).

** libgnutls: The default pull_timeout_function only uses select
instead of a combination of select() and recv() to prevent issues
when used in stream sockets in some systems.

** libgnutls: Be tolerant in ECDSA signature violations (e.g. using
SHA256 with a SECP384 curve instead of SHA-384), to interoperate with
openssl.

** libgnutls: Fixed DSA and ECDSA signature generation in smart
cards. Thanks to Andreas Schwier from cardcontact.de for providing
me with ECDSA capable smart cards.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_sign_algorithm_get: Added
gnutls_sign_get_hash_algorithm: Added

* Version 3.1.0 (released 2012-08-15)

** libgnutls: Added direct support for TPM as a cryptographic module
in gnutls/tpm.h. TPM keys can be used in functions accepting files
using URLs of the following types:
  tpmkey:file=/path/to/file
  tpmkey:uuid=7f468c16-cb7f-11e1-824d-b3a4f4b20343;storage=user

** libgnutls: Priority string level keywords can be combined.
For example the string "SECURE256:+SUITEB128" is now allowed.

** libgnutls: requires libnettle 2.5.

** libgnutls: Use the PKCS #1 1.5 encoding provided by nettle (2.5)
for encryption and signatures.

** libgnutls: Added GNUTLS_CERT_SIGNATURE_FAILURE to differentiate between
generic errors and signature verification errors in the verification
functions.

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_pkcs12_simple_parse() as a helper function
to simplify parsing in most PKCS #12 use cases.

** libgnutls: gnutls_certificate_set_x509_simple_pkcs12_file() adds
the whole certificate chain (if any) to the credentials structure, instead
of only the end-user certificate.

** libgnutls: Key import functions such as gnutls_pkcs12_simple_parse()
and gnutls_x509_privkey_import_pkcs8(), return consistently
GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED if the input structure is encrypted but no
password was provided.

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_handshake_set_timeout() a function that
allows to set the maximum time spent in a handshake.

** libgnutlsxx: Added session::set_transport_vec_push_function. Patch
by Alexandre Bique.

** tpmtool: Added. It is a tool to generate private keys in the
TPM.

** gnutls-cli: --benchmark-tls was split to --benchmark-tls-kx
and --benchmark-tls-ciphers

** certtool: generated PKCS #12 structures may hold more than one
private key. Patch by Lucas Fisher.

** certtool: Added option --null-password to generate/decrypt keys
that use a NULL password (in schemas that distinguish between NULL
an empty passwords).

** minitasn1: Upgraded to libtasn1 version 2.13.

on patch by David Woodhouse.

** libgnutls: Fixed memory leak in PKCS #8 key import.

** libgnutls: Added support for an old version of the DTLS protocol
used by openconnect vpn client for compatibility with Cisco's AnyConnect
SSL VPN. It is marked as GNUTLS_DTLS0_9. Do not use it for newer protocols
as it has issues.

is assumed to be a file that stores the pin. Based on patch
by David Smith.

** libgnutls: gnutls_record_check_pending() no longer
returns unprocessed data, and thus ensure the non-blocking
of the next call to gnutls_record_recv().

** libgnutls: Added strict tests in Diffie-Hellman and
SRP key exchange public keys.

** libgnutls: in ECDSA and DSA TLS 1.2 authentication be less

strings to enable the NSA SuiteB cryptography ciphersuites.

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_pubkey_verify_data2() that will
verify data provided the signature algorithm.

** libgnutls: Simplified the handling of handshake messages to
be hashed. Instead of hashing during the handshake process we now
keep the data until handshake is over and hash them on request.
This uses more memory but eliminates issues with TLS 1.2 and
simplifies code.

** libgnutls: Added AES-GCM optimizations using the PCLMULQDQ
instruction. Uses Andy Polyakov's assembly code.

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_named_crt() and

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_global_set_audit_log_function() that allows
to get important auditing information including the corresponding session.
That might be useful to block DoS or other attacker from specific IPs.

** libgnutls: gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_import_url() will now correctly read
the public key algorithm of the key.

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_certificate_get_issuer() and
gnutls_x509_trust_list_get_issuer() to compensate for the
missing gnutls_certificate_get_x509_cas().

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_x509_crq_verify() to allow
verification of the self signature in a certificate request.
This allows verifying whether the owner of the private key
is the generator of the request.

** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_crt_set_crq() implicitly verifies
the self signature of the request.

weak, several sites require it for connection. It is enabled for
"NORMAL" and "PERFORMANCE" priority strings.

** libgnutls: depend on libdl.

** libgnutls-extra: Dropped support of LZO compression via liblzo.

** libgnutls: gnutls_transport_set_global_errno() was removed. This
function required GnuTLS to access system specific data, for no reason.
Use gnutls_transport_set_errno(), or your system's errno fascility
instead.

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function2()
to set a callback to retrieve a certificate. The certificate is
received in a format that requires no processing from gnutls thus
it is suitable when performance is required.

** libgnutls: Corrected signature generation and verification
in the Certificate Verify message when in TLS 1.2. Reported
by Todd A. Ouska.

** libgnutlsxx: The C++ interface returns exception on
every error and not only on fatal ones. This allows easier
handling of errors.

** libgnutls: Corrected issue in DHE-PSK ciphersuites that ignored
the PSK callback.

** libgnutls: SRP and PSK are no longer set on the default priorities.
They have to be explicitly set.

** libgnutls: During handshake message verification using DSS
use the hash algorithm required by it.

** libgnutls: gnutls_recv() return GNUTLS_E_PREMATURE_TERMINATION
on unexpected EOF, instead of GNUTLS_E_UNEXPECTED_PACKET_LENGTH.

** libgnutls: Added GCM mode (interoperates with tls.secg.org)

** libgnutls-extra: Inner application extension was removed.
It was never standardized nor published as an RFC.

** libgnutls: Added new certificate verification functions, that
can provide more details and are more efficient. Check
gnutls_x509_trust_list_*.

** certtool: Uses the new certificate verification functions for
--verify-chain.

** certtool: Added new certificate verification functionality
using the --verify option. Combined with --load-ca-certificate
it can verify a certificate chain against a list of certificates.

Reported by Jeffrey Walton.

** libgnutls: Added SIGN-ALL, CTYPE-ALL, COMP-ALL, and VERS-TLS-ALL
as priority strings. Those allow to set all the supported algorithms
at once.

** p11tool: Introduced. It allows manipulating pkcs 11 tokens.

gnutls_pkcs11_token_set_pin: New function

* Version 2.11.4 (released 2010-10-15)

** libgnutls: Add new API gnutls_session_channel_binding.
The function is used to get the channel binding data.  Currently only
the "tls-unique" (RFC 5929) channel binding type is supported, through
the GNUTLS_CB_TLS_UNIQUE type.  See new section "Channel Bindings" in
the manual.

** gnutls-cli, gnutls-serv: Print 'tls-unique' Channel Bindings.

** doc: Added pkcs11.h header file to GTK-DOC manual.

** libgnutls: Nettle is the default crypto back end. Use --with-libgcrypt
to use the libgcrypt back end.

** libgnutls: Depend on nettle 2.1. This makes nettle a fully working
backend crypto library.

** libgnutls: Added RSA_NULL_SHA1 and SHA256 ciphersuites.

** libgnutls: Several updates in the buffering internal interface.

** libgnutls: Is now more liberal in the PEM decoding. That is spaces and
tabs are being skipped.

** libgnutls: Added support for draft-pechanec-pkcs11uri-02.

** libgnutls: The %COMPAT flag now allows larger records that violate the
TLS spec.

** libgnutls: by default lowat level has been set to zero to avoid unnecessary
system calls. Applications that depended on it being 1 should explicitly call
gnutls_transport_set_lowat().

** libgnutls: Updated documentation and gnutls_pk_params_t mappings
to ECRYPT II recommendations. Mappings were moved to a single location
and DSA keys are handled differently (since DSA2 allows for 1024,2048
and 3072 keys only).

** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_privkey_import() will fallback to
gnutls_x509_privkey_import_pkcs8() without a password, if it
is unable to decode the key.

** libgnutls: HMAC-MD5 no longer used by default.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_openpgp_privkey_sec_param: ADDED
gnutls_x509_privkey_sec_param: ADDED

* Version 2.11.0 (released 2010-07-22)

** libgnutls: support scattered write using writev(). This takes
advantage of the new buffering layer and allows queuing of packets
and flushing them. This is currently used for handshake messages
only.

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_global_set_mutex() to allow setting
alternative locking procedures. By default the system available
locking is used. In *NIX pthreads are used and in windows the
critical section API. This follows a different approach than the
previous versions that depended on libgcrypt initialization. The
locks are now set by default in systems that support it. Programs
that used gcry_control() to set thread locks should insert it into
a block of
#if GNUTLS_VERSION_NUMBER <= 0x020b00
	gcry_control(...)
#endif

** libgnutls: Added support for reading DN from EV-certificates.
New DN values:
jurisdictionOfIncorporationLocalityName,
jurisdictionOfIncorporationStateOrProvinceName,
jurisdictionOfIncorporationCountryName

** libgnutls: Added support for DSA signing/verifying with bit
length over 1024.

** libgnutls-extra: When in FIPS mode gnutls_global_init_extra()
has to be called to register any required md5 handlers.

** libgnutls: Internal buffering code was replaced by simpler
code contributed by Jonathan Bastien-Filiatrault.

** libgnutls: Internal API for extensions augmented to allow
safe storing and loading of data on resumption. This allows writing
self-contained extensions (when possible). As a side effect
the OPRFI extension was removed.

** libgnutls: Added support for DSA-SHA256 and DSA-SHA224

** libgnutls: Added PKCS #11 support and an API to access objects in
gnutls/pkcs11.h. Currently certificates and public keys can be
imported from tokens, and operations can be performed on private keys.

** libgnutls: Added abstract gnutls_privkey_t and gnutls_pubkey_t

** libgnutls: Added initial support for the nettle library. It uses
the system's random generator for seeding. That is /dev/urandom in Linux,
system calls in Win32 and EGD on other systems.

** libgnutls: Corrected issue on the %SSL3_RECORD_VERSION priority string. It now
    works even when resuming a session.

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function() to replace the
similar gnutls_certificate_set_server_retrieve_function() and
gnutls_certificate_set_client_retrieve_function(). In addition it support
PKCS #11 private keys.

** libgnutls: Added  gnutls_pkcs11_copy_x509_crt(), gnutls_pkcs11_copy_x509_privkey(),
and gnutls_pkcs11_delete_url() to allow copying and deleting data in tokens.

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_sec_param_to_pk_bits() et al. to allow select bit
sizes for private keys using a human understandable scale.

** certtool: Added new options: --pkcs11-list-tokens, --pkcs11-list-all
--pkcs11-list-all-certs, --pkcs11-list-trusted, --pkcs11-list-certs,
--pkcs11-delete-url, --pkcs11-write

certtool: The --pkcs-cipher is taken into account when generating a
private key. The default cipher used now is aes-128. The old behavior can
be simulated by specifying "--pkcs-cipher 3des-pkcs12".

certtool: Added --certificate-pubkey to print the public key of the
certificate.

** gnutls-cli/gnutls-serv: --x509cafile, --x509certfile and --x509keyfile
can now accept a PKCS #11 URL in addition to a file. This will allow for
example to use the Gnome-keyring trusted certificate list to verify
connections using a url such as:
pkcs11:token=Root%20CA%20Certificates;serial=1%3AROOTS%3ADEFAULT;model=1%2E0;manufacturer=Gnome%20Keyring

* Version 2.10.1 (released 2010-07-25)

** libgnutls: Added support for broken certificates that indicate RSA
with strange OIDs.

** gnutls-cli: Allow verification using V1 CAs.

** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_privkey_import() will fallback to
gnutls_x509_privkey_import_pkcs8() without a password, if it
is unable to decode the key.

** libgnutls: Correctly deinitialize crypto API functions to prevent
a memory leak.  Reported by Mads Kiilerich.

** certtool: If asked to generate DSA keys of size more than 1024 bits,
issue a warning, that the output key might not be working everywhere.

** certtool: The --pkcs-cipher is taken into account when generating a
private key. The default cipher used now is aes-128. The old behavior
can be simulated by specifying "--pkcs-cipher 3des-pkcs12".

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.10.0 (released 2010-06-25)

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.9.12 (released 2010-06-17)

** gnutls-cli: Make --starttls work again.
Problem introduced in patch to use read() instead of fgets() committed
on 2010-01-27.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.9.11 (released 2010-06-07)

** libgnutls: Removed two APIs related to safe renegotiation.
Use priority strings instead.  The APIs were
gnutls_safe_negotiation_set_initial and gnutls_safe_renegotiation_set.
(Remember that we don't promise ABI stability during development
series, so this doesn't cause an shared library ABI increment.)

** tests: More self testing of safe renegotiation extension.
See tests/safe-renegotiation/README for more information.

** doc: a PDF version of the API reference manual (GTK-DOC) is now built.

** doc: Terms 'GNUTLS' and 'GNU TLS' were changed to 'GnuTLS' for consistency.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_safe_negotiation_set_initial: REMOVED.
gnutls_safe_renegotiation_set: REMOVED.

* Version 2.9.10 (released 2010-04-22)

** libgnutls: Time verification extended to trusted certificate list.
Unless new constant GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_TRUSTED_TIME_CHECKS flag is
specified.

** certtool: Display postalCode and Name X.509 DN attributes correctly.
Based on patch by Pavan Konjarla.  Adds new constant
GNUTLS_OID_X520_POSTALCODE and GNUTLS_OID_X520_NAME.

** libgnutls: Added Steve Dispensa's patch for safe renegotiation (RFC 5746)
Solves the issue discussed in:
<http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg03928.html> and
<http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg03948.html>.
Note that to allow connecting to unpatched servers the full protection
is only enabled if the priority string %SAFE_RENEGOTIATION is
specified. You can check whether protection is in place by querying
gnutls_safe_renegotiation_status().  New error codes
GNUTLS_E_SAFE_RENEGOTIATION_FAILED and
GNUTLS_E_UNSAFE_RENEGOTIATION_DENIED added.

** libgnutls: When checking openpgp self signature also check the signatures
** of all subkeys.
Ilari Liusvaara noticed and reported the issue and provided test
vectors as well.

** libgnutls: Added cryptodev support (/dev/crypto).
Tested with http://www.logix.cz/michal/devel/cryptodev/.  Added
benchmark utility for AES.  Adds new error codes
GNUTLS_E_CRYPTODEV_IOCTL_ERROR and GNUTLS_E_CRYPTODEV_DEVICE_ERROR.

** libgnutls: Exported API to access encryption and hash algorithms.
The new API functions are gnutls_cipher_decrypt, gnutls_cipher_deinit,
gnutls_cipher_encrypt, gnutls_cipher_get_block_size,
gnutls_cipher_init, gnutls_hash, gnutls_hash_deinit, gnutls_hash_fast,
gnutls_hash_get_len, gnutls_hash_init, gnutls_hash_output,
gnutls_hmac, gnutls_hmac_deinit, gnutls_hmac_fast,
gnutls_hmac_get_len, gnutls_hmac_init, gnutls_hmac_output.  New API
constants are GNUTLS_MAC_SHA224 and GNUTLS_DIG_SHA224.

** libgnutls: Added gnutls_certificate_set_verify_function() to allow
verification of certificate upon receipt rather than waiting until the
end of the handshake.

** libgnutls: Don't send alerts during handshake.
Instead new error code GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_SRP_USERNAME is added.

** certtool: Corrected two issues that affected certificate request generation.
(1) Null padding is added on integers (found thanks to Wilankar Trupti),
(2) In optional SignatureAlgorithm parameters field for DSA keys the DSA
parameters were added. Those were rejected by Verisign. Gnutls no longer adds
those parameters there since other implementations don't do either and having
them does not seem to offer anything (anyway you need the signer's certificate
to verify thus public key will be available). Found thanks to Boyan Kasarov.
This however has the side-effect that public key IDs shown by certtool are
now different than previous gnutls releases.
(3) the option --pgp-certificate-info will verify self signatures

** certtool: Allow exporting of Certificate requests on DER format.

** certtool: New option --no-crq-extensions to avoid extensions in CSRs.

** gnutls-cli: Handle reading binary data from server.
Reported by and tiny patch from Vitaly Mayatskikh
<v.mayatskih@gmail.com> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/4096>.

<https://savannah.gnu.org/support/?107029>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.9.8 (released 2009-11-05)

** libgnutls: Fix for memory leaks on interrupted handshake.
Reported by Tang Tong.

** libgnutls: Addition of support for TLS 1.2 signature algorithms
** extension and certificate verify field.
This requires changes for TLS 1.2 servers and clients that use
callbacks for certificate retrieval.  They are now required to check
with gnutls_sign_algorithm_get_requested() whether the certificate
they send complies with the peer's preferences in signature
algorithms.

** libgnutls: In server side when resuming a session do not overwrite the
** initial session data with the resumed session data.

** libgnutls: Added support for AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256 in PKCS #8
** encryption.
This affects also PKCS #12 encoded files.  This adds the following new
enums: GNUTLS_CIPHER_AES_192_CBC, GNUTLS_PKCS_USE_PBES2_AES_128,
GNUTLS_PKCS_USE_PBES2_AES_192, GNUTLS_PKCS_USE_PBES2_AES_256.

** libgnutls: Fix PKCS#12 encoding.
The error you would get was "The OID is not supported.".  Problem
introduced for the v2.8.x branch in 2.7.6.

** certtool: Added the --pkcs-cipher option.
To explicitely specify the encryption algorithm to use.

** tests: Added "pkcs12_encode" self-test to check PKCS#12 functions.

** tests: Fix time bomb in chainverify self-test.
Reported by Andreas Metzler <ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3925>.

** tests: Fix expired cert in chainverify self-test.

** i18n: Vietnamese translation updated.
Thanks to Clytie Siddall.

** API and ABI modifications:
GNUTLS_CIPHER_AES_192_CBC: ADDED to gnutls/gnutls.h.
GNUTLS_PKCS_USE_PBES2_AES_128: ADDED to gnutls/x509.h.
GNUTLS_PKCS_USE_PBES2_AES_192: ADDED to gnutls/x509.h.

** libgnutls: Enable Camellia ciphers by default.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.9.5 (released 2009-09-10)

** libgnutls: Add new functions to extract X.509 Issuer Alternative Names.
The new functions are gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_alt_name2,
gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_alt_name, and
gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_alt_othername_oid.  Contributed by Brad
Hards <bradh@frogmouth.net>.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_alt_name2: ADDED.
gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_alt_name: ADDED.
gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_alt_othername_oid: ADDED.

* Version 2.9.4 (released 2009-09-03)

** libgnutls: Client-side TLS 1.2 and SHA-256 ciphersuites now works.
The new supported ciphersuites are AES-128/256 in CBC mode with
ANON-DH/RSA/DHE-DSS/DHE-RSA.  Contributed by Daiki Ueno.  Further,
SHA-256 is now the preferred default MAC (however it is only used with
TLS 1.2).

** libgnutls: Make OpenPGP hostname checking work again.
The patch to resolve the X.509 CN/SAN issue accidentally broken
OpenPGP hostname comparison.

** libgnutls: When printing X.509 certificates, handle XMPP SANs better.
Reported by Howard Chu <hyc@symas.com> in
<https://savannah.gnu.org/support/?106975>.

** Fix use of deprecated types internally.
Use of deprecated types in GnuTLS from now on will lead to a compile
error, to prevent this from happening again.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.9.3 (released 2009-08-19)

** libgnutls: Support for TLS tickets was contributed by Daiki Ueno.
The new APIs are gnutls_session_ticket_enable_client,
gnutls_session_ticket_enable_server, and
gnutls_session_ticket_key_generate.

** gnutls-cli, gnutls-serv: New parameter --noticket to disable TLS tickets.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_session_ticket_key_generate: ADDED.
gnutls_session_ticket_enable_client: ADDED.
gnutls_session_ticket_enable_server: ADDED.

* Version 2.9.2 (released 2009-08-14)

** libgnutls: Fix problem with NUL bytes in X.509 CN and SAN fields.
By using a NUL byte in CN/SAN fields, it was possible to fool GnuTLS
into 1) not printing the entire CN/SAN field value when printing a
certificate and 2) cause incorrect positive matches when matching a
hostname against a certificate.  Some CAs apparently have poor
checking of CN/SAN values and issue these (arguable invalid)
certificates.  Combined, this can be used by attackers to become a
MITM on server-authenticated TLS sessions.  The problem is mitigated
since attackers needs to get one certificate per site they want to
attack, and the attacker reveals his tracks by applying for a
certificate at the CA.  It does not apply to client authenticated TLS
sessions.  Research presented independently by Dan Kaminsky and Moxie
Marlinspike at BlackHat09.  Thanks to Tomas Hoger <thoger@redhat.com>
for providing one part of the patch.  [GNUTLS-SA-2009-4] [CVE-2009-2730].

** libgnutls: Fix rare failure in gnutls_x509_crt_import.
The function may fail incorrectly when an earlier certificate was
imported to the same gnutls_x509_crt_t structure.

** minitasn1: Internal copy updated to libtasn1 v2.3.

** libgnutls: Fix return value of gnutls_certificate_client_get_request_status.
Before it always returned false.  Reported by Peter Hendrickson
<pdh@wiredyne.com> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3668>.

** libgnutls: Fix off-by-one size computation error in unknown DN printing.
The error resulted in truncated strings when printing unknown OIDs in
X.509 certificate DNs.  Reported by Tim Kosse
<tim.kosse@filezilla-project.org> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3651>.

** libgnutls: Fix PKCS#12 decryption from password.
The encryption key derived from the password was incorrect for (on
average) 1 in every 128 input for random inputs.  Reported by "Kukosa,
Tomas" <tomas.kukosa@siemens-enterprise.com> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.network.gnutls.general/1663>.

** libgnutls: Return correct bit lengths of some MPIs.
gnutls_dh_get_prime_bits, gnutls_rsa_export_get_modulus_bits, and
gnutls_dh_get_peers_public_bits.  Before the reported value was
overestimated.  Reported by Peter Hendrickson <pdh@wiredyne.com> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3607>.

** libgnutls: Avoid internal error when invoked after GNUTLS_E_AGAIN.
Report and patch by Tim Kosse <tim.kosse@filezilla-project.org> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3671>
and
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3670>.

** libgnutls: Relax checking of required libtasn1/libgcrypt versions.
Before we required that the runtime library used the same (or more
recent) libgcrypt/libtasn1 as it was compiled with.  Now we just check
that the runtime usage is above the minimum required.  Reported by
Marco d'Itri <md@linux.it> via Andreas Metzler
<ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org> in <http://bugs.debian.org/540449>.

** tests: Added new self-test pkcs12_s2k_pem to detect MPI bit length error.

** tests: Improved test vectors in self-test pkcs12_s2k.

** tests: Added new self-test dn2 to detect off-by-one size error.

** tests: Fix failure in "chainverify" because a certificate have expired.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.9.1 (released 2009-06-08)

** libgnutls: Fix crash in gnutls_global_init after earlier init/deinit cycle.
Forwarded by Martin von Gagern <Martin.vGagern@gmx.net> from
<http://bugs.gentoo.org/272388>.

** tests: Added new self-tests init_roundtrip.c to detect previous problem.

** Reduce stack usage for some CRQ functions.

** Doc fixes for CRQ functions.

** API and ABI modifications:

* Version 2.9.0 (released 2009-05-28)

** Doc fixes.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.8.6 (released 2010-03-15)

** libgnutls: For CSRs, don't null pad integers for RSA/DSA value.
VeriSign rejected CSRs with this padding.  Reported by Wilankar Trupti
<trupti.wilankar@hp.com> and Boyan Kasarov <bkasarov@gmail.com>.

Note: As a side effect of this change, the "public key identifier"
value computed for a certificate using this version of GnuTLS will be
different from values computed using earlier versions of GnuTLS.

** libgnutls: For CSRs on DSA keys, don't add DSA parameters to the
** optional SignatureAlgorithm parameter field.
VeriSign rejected these CSRs.  They are stricly speaking not needed
since you need the signer's certificate to verify the certificate
signature anyway.  Reported by Wilankar Trupti
<trupti.wilankar@hp.com> and Boyan Kasarov <bkasarov@gmail.com>.

** libgnutls: When checking openpgp self signature also check the signatures
** of all subkeys.
Ilari Liusvaara noticed and reported the issue and provided test
vectors as well.

* Version 2.8.2 (released 2009-08-10)

** libgnutls: Fix problem with NUL bytes in X.509 CN and SAN fields.
By using a NUL byte in CN/SAN fields, it was possible to fool GnuTLS
into 1) not printing the entire CN/SAN field value when printing a
certificate and 2) cause incorrect positive matches when matching a
hostname against a certificate.  Some CAs apparently have poor
checking of CN/SAN values and issue these (arguable invalid)
certificates.  Combined, this can be used by attackers to become a
MITM on server-authenticated TLS sessions.  The problem is mitigated
since attackers needs to get one certificate per site they want to
attack, and the attacker reveals his tracks by applying for a
certificate at the CA.  It does not apply to client authenticated TLS
sessions.  Research presented independently by Dan Kaminsky and Moxie
Marlinspike at BlackHat09.  Thanks to Tomas Hoger <thoger@redhat.com>
for providing one part of the patch.  [GNUTLS-SA-2009-4].

recent) libgcrypt/libtasn1 as it was compiled with.  Now we just check
that the runtime usage is above the minimum required.  Reported by

*** API/ABI changes in GnuTLS 2.8 compared to GnuTLS 2.6.x
No offically supported interfaces have been modified or removed.  The
library should be completely backwards compatible on both the source
and binary level.

The shared library no longer exports some symbols that have never been
officially supported, i.e., not mentioned in any of the header files.
The symbols are:

  _gnutls*
  gnutls_asn1_tab

Normally when symbols are removed, the shared library version has to
be incremented.  This leads to a significant cost for everyone using
the library.  Because none of the above symbols have ever been
intended for use by well-behaved applications, we decided that the it
would be better for those applications to pay the price rather than
incurring problems on the majority of applications.

If it turns out that applications have been using unofficial
interfaces, we will need to release a follow-on release on the v2.8
branch to exports additional interfaces.  However, initial testing
suggests that few if any applications have been using any of the
internal symbols.

Although not a new change compared to 2.6.x, we'd like to remind you
interfaces have been modified so that X.509 chain verification now
also checks activation/expiration times on certificates.  The affected
functions are:

gnutls_x509_crt_list_verify: CHANGED, checks activation/expiration times.
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers: Likewise.
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2: Likewise.
GNUTLS_CERT_NOT_ACTIVATED: ADDED.
GNUTLS_CERT_EXPIRED: ADDED.
GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_TIME_CHECKS: ADDED.

This change in behaviour was made during the GnuTLS 2.6.x cycle, and
we gave our rationale for it in earlier release notes.

The following symbols have been added to the library:

gnutls_certificate_set_x509_simple_pkcs12_mem: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crl_get_authority_key_id: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crl_get_extension_data: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crl_get_extension_info: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crl_get_extension_oid: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crl_get_number: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crl_set_authority_key_id: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crl_set_number: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_get_attribute_data: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_get_attribute_info: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_get_basic_constraints: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_get_extension_by_oid: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_get_extension_data: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_get_extension_info: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_get_key_id: ADDED.
gnutls_x509_crq_get_key_purpose_oid: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_get_key_rsa_raw: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_get_key_usage: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_get_subject_alt_name: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_get_subject_alt_othername_oid: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_print: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_set_basic_constraints: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_set_key_purpose_oid: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_set_key_usage: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crq_set_subject_alt_name: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crt_get_verify_algorithm: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crt_set_crq_extensions: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crt_verify_hash: ADDED

The following interfaces have been added to the header files:

GNUTLS_VERSION: ADDED, replaces LIBGNUTLS_VERSION.
GNUTLS_VERSION_MAJOR: ADDED, replaces LIBGNUTLS_VERSION_MAJOR.
GNUTLS_VERSION_MINOR: ADDED, replaces LIBGNUTLS_VERSION_MINOR.

* Version 2.7.8 (released 2009-05-03)

** libgnutls: Fix DSA key generation.
Merged from stable branch.  [GNUTLS-SA-2009-2] [CVE-2009-1416]

** libgnutls: Check expiration/activation time on untrusted certificates.
Merged from stable branch.  Reported by Romain Francoise
<romain@orebokech.com>.  This changes the semantics of
gnutls_x509_crt_list_verify, which in turn is used by
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers and gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2.
We add two new gnutls_certificate_status_t codes for reporting the new
error condition, GNUTLS_CERT_NOT_ACTIVATED and GNUTLS_CERT_EXPIRED.
We also add a new gnutls_certificate_verify_flags flag,
GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_TIME_CHECKS, that can be used to disable the new
behaviour.  [GNUTLS-SA-2009-3] [CVE-2009-1417]

** lib: Linker version scripts reduces number of exported symbols.
The linker version script now lists all exported ABIs explicitly, to
avoid accidentally exporting unintended functions.  Compared to
before, most symbols beginning with _gnutls* are no longer exported.
These functions have never been intended for use by applications, and
there were no prototypes for these function in the public header
files.  Thus we believe it is possible to do this without incrementing
the library ABI version which normally has to be done when removing an
interface.

** lib: Limit exported symbols on systems without LD linker scripts.
Before all symbols were exported.  Now we limit the exported symbols
to (for libgnutls and libgnutls-extra) gnutls* and (for libgnutls)
_gnutls*.  This is a superset of the actual supported ABI, but still
an improvement compared to before.  This is implemented using Libtool
-export-symbols-regex.  It is more portable than linker version
scripts.

** libgnutls: Incremented CURRENT/AGE libtool version to reflect new symbols.
This should have been done in the last release.

** gnutls-serv: Listen on all interfaces, including both IPv4 and IPv6.
Reported by Peter Hendrickson <pdh@wiredyne.com> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3476>.

** doc: Improved sections for the info manual.
We now follow the advice given by the texinfo manual on which
directory categories to use.  In particular, libgnutls moved from the
'GNU Libraries' section to the 'Software libraries' and the command
line tools moved from 'Network Applications' to 'System
Administration'.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crt_list_verify: CHANGED, checks activation/expiration times.
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers: Likewise.
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2: Likewise.
GNUTLS_CERT_NOT_ACTIVATED: ADDED.
GNUTLS_CERT_EXPIRED: ADDED.
GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_TIME_CHECKS: ADDED.

* Version 2.7.7 (released 2009-04-20)

** libgnutls: Applied patch by Cedric Bail to add functions
gnutls_x509_crt_verify_hash() and gnutls_x509_crt_get_verify_algorithm().

** gnutls.pc: Add -ltasn1 to 'pkg-config --libs --static gnutls' output.
Reported by Andreas Metzler <ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org> in
<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3467>.

** minitasn1: Internal copy updated to libtasn1 v1.8.
GnuTLS is also internally ready to be used with libtasn1 v2.0.

** doc: Fix build failure of errcodes/printlist.
Reported by Roman Bogorodskiy <novel@FreeBSD.org> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3435>.

** i18n: The GnuTLS gettext domain is now 'libgnutls' instead of 'gnutls'.
It is currently only used by the core library.  This will enable a new
domain 'gnutls' for translations of the command line tools.

** Corrected possible memory corruption on signature verification failure.
Reported by Miroslav Kratochvil <exa.exa@gmail.com>

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crt_verify_hash: ADDED
gnutls_x509_crt_get_verify_algorithm: ADDED

* Version 2.7.6 (released 2009-02-27)

** certtool: Query for multiple dnsName subjectAltName in interactive mode.
This applies both to generating certificates and certificate requests.

** pkix.asn: Removed unneeded definitions to reduce memory usage.

** gnutls-cli: No longer accepts V1 CAs by default during X.509 chain verify.
Use --priority NORMAL:%VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT to permit V1 CAs to
be used for chain verification.

** gnutls-serv: No longer disable MAC padding by default.
Use --priority NORMAL:%COMPAT to disable MAC padding again.

** gnutls-cli: Certificate information output format changed.
The tool now uses libgnutls' functions to print certificate
information.  This avoids code duplication.

** libgnutls: New priority strings %VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD5
** and %VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT.
They can be used to override the default certificate chain validation
behaviour.

** libgnutls: Added %SSL3_RECORD_VERSION priority string that allows to
specify the client hello message record version. Used to overcome buggy
TLS servers. Report by Martin von Gagern.

** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_crt_print prints signature algorithm in oneline mode.

** libgnutls: gnutls_openpgp_crt_print supports oneline mode.

** doc: Update gnutls-cli and gnutls-serv --help output descriptions.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.7.5 (released 2009-02-06)

** libgnutls: Accept chains where intermediary certs are trusted.
Before GnuTLS needed to validate the entire chain back to a
self-signed certificate.  GnuTLS will now stop looking when it has
found an intermediary trusted certificate.  The new behaviour is
useful when chains, for example, contains a top-level CA, an
intermediary CA signed using RSA-MD5, and an end-entity certificate.
To avoid chain validation errors due to the RSA-MD5 cert, you can
explicitly add the intermediary RSA-MD5 cert to your trusted certs.
The signature on trusted certificates are not checked, so the chain
has a chance to validate correctly.  Reported by "Douglas E. Engert"
<deengert@anl.gov> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3351>.

** libgnutls: result_size in gnutls_hex_encode now holds
the size of the result. Report by John Brooks <special@dereferenced.net>.

** libgnutls: gnutls_handshake when sending client hello during a
rehandshake, will not offer a version number larger than the current.
Reported by Tristan Hill <stan@saticed.me.uk>.

** libgnutls: Permit V1 Certificate Authorities properly.
Before they were mistakenly rejected even though
GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_ANY_X509_V1_CA_CRT and/or
GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT were supplied.  Reported by
"Douglas E. Engert" <deengert@anl.gov> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3351>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.7.4 (released 2009-01-07)

** libgnutls: deprecate X.509 validation chains using MD5 and MD2 signatures.
This is a bugfix -- the previous attempt to do this from internal x509
certificate verification procedures did not return the correct value
for certificates using a weak hash.  Reported by Daniel Kahn Gillmor
<dkg@fifthhorseman.net> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3332>,
debugged and patch by Tomas Mraz <tmraz@redhat.com> and Daniel Kahn

** libgnutls: New interface to get key id for certificate requests.
Patch from David Marín Carreño <davefx@gmail.com> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3321>.

** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_crq_print will now also print public key id.

** certtool: --verify-chain now prints results of using library verification.
Earlier, certtool --verify-chain used its own validation algorithm
which wasn't guaranteed to give the same result as the libgnutls
internal validation algorithm.  Now this command print a new final
line with header 'Chain verification output:' that contains the result
from using the internal verification algorithm on the same chain.

** tests: Add crq_key_id self-test of gnutls_x509_crq_get_key_id.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crq_get_key_id: ADDED.

* Version 2.7.3 (released 2008-12-10)

** libgnutls: Fix chain verification for chains that ends with RSA-MD2 CAs.
Reported by Michael Kiefer <Michael-Kiefer@web.de> in
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=507633> forwarded by
Andreas Metzler <ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3309>.

** libgnutls: Libgcrypt initialization changed.
If libgcrypt has not already been initialized, GnuTLS will now
initialize libgcrypt with disabled secure memory.  Initialize
libgcrypt explicitly in your application if you want to enable secure
memory.  Before GnuTLS initialized libgcrypt to use GnuTLS's memory
allocation functions, which doesn't use secure memory, so there is no
real change in behaviour.

** libgnutls: Fix memory leak in PSK authentication.
Reported by Michael Weiser <michael@weiser.dinsnail.net> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.network.gnutls.general/1465>.

** libgnutls: Small byte reads via gnutls_record_recv() optimized.

** certtool: Move gcry_control(GCRYCTL_ENABLE_QUICK_RANDOM, 0) call earlier.
It needs to be invoked before libgcrypt is initialized.

** gnutls-cli: Return non-zero exit code on error conditions.

** gnutls-cli: Corrected bug which caused a rehandshake request to be ignored.

** tests: Added chainverify self-test that tests X.509 chain verifications.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.7.2 (released 2008-11-18)

** libgnutls: Fix X.509 certificate chain validation error. [GNUTLS-SA-2008-3]
The flaw makes it possible for man in the middle attackers (i.e.,

* Version 2.6.6 (released 2009-04-30)

** libgnutls: Corrected double free on signature verification failure.
Reported by Miroslav Kratochvil <exa.exa@gmail.com>.  See the advisory
for more details.  [GNUTLS-SA-2009-1] [CVE-2009-1415]

** libgnutls: Fix DSA key generation.
Noticed when investigating the previous GNUTLS-SA-2009-1 problem.  All
DSA keys generated using GnuTLS 2.6.x are corrupt.  See the advisory
for more details.  [GNUTLS-SA-2009-2] [CVE-2009-1416]

** libgnutls: Check expiration/activation time on untrusted certificates.
Reported by Romain Francoise <romain@orebokech.com>.  Before the
library did not check activation/expiration times on certificates, and
was documented as not doing so.  We have realized that many
applications that use libgnutls, including gnutls-cli, fail to perform
proper checks.  Implementing similar logic in all applications leads
to code duplication.  Hence, we decided to check whether the current
time (as reported by the time function) is within the
activation/expiration period of certificates when verifying untrusted
certificates.

This changes the semantics of gnutls_x509_crt_list_verify, which in
turn is used by gnutls_certificate_verify_peers and
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2.  We add two new
gnutls_certificate_status_t codes for reporting the new error
condition, GNUTLS_CERT_NOT_ACTIVATED and GNUTLS_CERT_EXPIRED.  We also
add a new gnutls_certificate_verify_flags flag,
GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_TIME_CHECKS, that can be used to disable the new
behaviour.

More details about the vulnerabilities will be posted at
<https://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html>.

** gnutls-cli, gnutls-cli-debug: Fix AIX build problem.
Reported by LAUPRETRE François (P) <francois.laupretre@ratp.fr> in

** tests: Fix linking of tests/openpgp/keyring self-test.
Reported by Daniel Black in <https://savannah.gnu.org/support/?106543>.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crt_list_verify: CHANGED, checks activation/expiration times.
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers: Likewise.
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2: Likewise.
GNUTLS_CERT_NOT_ACTIVATED: ADDED.
GNUTLS_CERT_EXPIRED: ADDED.
GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_TIME_CHECKS: ADDED.

* Version 2.6.5 (released 2009-04-11)

** libgnutls: Added %SSL3_RECORD_VERSION priority string that allows to
specify the client hello message record version. Used to overcome buggy
TLS servers. Report by Martin von Gagern.

** GnuTLS no longer uses the libtasn1-config script to find libtasn1.
Libtasn1 0.3.4 or later is required.  This is to align with the
upcoming libtasn1 v2.0 release that doesn't have a libtasn1-script.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.6.4 (released 2009-02-06)

** libgnutls: Accept chains where intermediary certs are trusted.
Before GnuTLS needed to validate the entire chain back to a
self-signed certificate.  GnuTLS will now stop looking when it has
found an intermediary trusted certificate.  The new behaviour is
useful when chains, for example, contains a top-level CA, an
intermediary CA signed using RSA-MD5, and an end-entity certificate.
To avoid chain validation errors due to the RSA-MD5 cert, you can
explicitly add the intermediary RSA-MD5 cert to your trusted certs.
The signature on trusted certificates are not checked, so the chain
has a chance to validate correctly.  Reported by "Douglas E. Engert"
<deengert@anl.gov> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3351>.

** libgnutls: result_size in gnutls_hex_encode now holds
the size of the result. Report by John Brooks <special@dereferenced.net>.

** libgnutls: gnutls_handshake when sending client hello during a
rehandshake, will not offer a version number larger than the current.
Reported by Tristan Hill <stan@saticed.me.uk>.

** libgnutls: Permit V1 Certificate Authorities properly.
Before they were mistakenly rejected even though
GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_ANY_X509_V1_CA_CRT and/or
GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT were supplied.  Reported by
"Douglas E. Engert" <deengert@anl.gov> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3351>.

** libgnutls: deprecate X.509 validation chains using MD5 and MD2 signatures.
This is a bugfix -- the previous attempt to do this from internal x509
certificate verification procedures did not return the correct value
for certificates using a weak hash.  Reported by Daniel Kahn Gillmor
<dkg@fifthhorseman.net> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3332>,

* Version 2.6.0 (released 2008-10-06)

** libgnutls: Correct printing and parsing of IPv6 addresses.

** libgnutls-openssl: fix out of bounds access.
Problem in X509_get_subject_name and X509_get_issuer_name.  Tiny patch
from Thomas Viehmann <tv@beamnet.de>.

** certtool: Use inet_pton for parsing IPv6 addresses.

** Major changes compared to the v2.4 branch:

*** Added API to replace and update the crypto backend.

*** certtool: can add several subject alternative names via template file.

*** opencdk: Parse (but not decrypt) encrypted secret keys.

*** libgnutls: gnutls_x509_crt_set_subject_alt_name() was added that can
either set or append alternative names. It can also handle binary structures
such as IP addresses.

*** libgnutls: New function to set minimum acceptable SRP bits.
The function is gnutls_srp_set_prime_bits.

*** libgnutls: Add interface to deal with public key and signature algorithms.
The functions are called gnutls_pk_list, gnutls_pk_get_id,
gnutls_sign_list, and gnutls_sign_get_id.

*** libgnutls: New interfaces to get name of public key and signing algorithms.
The functions are gnutls_sign_get_name and gnutls_pk_get_name.

*** libgnutls: New API to get a string corresponding to a error symbol.
The function is gnutls_strerror_name.

*** libgnutls: New API to set the public parameters in a certificate request
*** from a private key.
The function is gnutls_x509_crq_set_key_rsa_raw.

*** libgnutls: New API to set a callback to extract TLS Finished data.
The function to register is gnutls_session_set_finished_function and
it takes a callback of the gnutls_finished_callback_func type.

*** libgnutls: Fix namespace problem with TLS_MASTER_SIZE and TLS_RANDOM_SIZE.

*** libgnutls: New interface to register a new TLS extension handler.
The new function gnutls_ext_register can be used to register handlers
for specific TLS extension types.  The callback functions have the new
types gnutls_ext_recv_func and gnutls_ext_send_func.  A type to
classify TLS extensions, gnutls_ext_parse_type_t, has been added as
well.

*** libgnutls-extra: Add function to work with Libgcrypt in FIPS mode.
The function is gnutls_register_md5_handler.  When libgcrypt is in
FIPS mode, MD5 is disabled, but TLS normally requires use of MD5 in
the PRF.

*** API/ABI changes in GnuTLS 2.6
No functions have been removed or modified.  The library should be
fully backwards compatible on both the source and binary level.

A new header file <gnutls/crypto.h> have been added.  It contains
definitions related to replacing the internal crypto functionality.
All definitions and the header itself is experimental but supported.

We have realized that the symbols TLS_MASTER_SIZE and TLS_RANDOM_SIZE
does not use the normal namespace.  We have added GNUTLS_MASTER_SIZE
and GNUTLS_RANDOM_SIZE, but the old symbols are still defined.

The following functions have been added to libgnutls:

GNUTLS_MASTER_SIZE
GNUTLS_RANDOM_SIZE
gnutls_crypto_bigint_register2
gnutls_crypto_cipher_register2
gnutls_crypto_digest_register2
gnutls_crypto_mac_register2

The function to register is gnutls_session_set_finished_function and
it takes a callback of the gnutls_finished_callback_func type.

** libgnutls: Drop final comma after GNUTLS_CRT_PRINT_UNSIGNED_FULL in enum.
Reported in <https://savannah.gnu.org/support/?106453>.

** libgnutls: Fix namespace problem with TLS_MASTER_SIZE and TLS_RANDOM_SIZE.
The new names are GNUTLS_MASTER_SIZE and GNUTLS_RANDOM_SIZE.  The old
names are mapped to the new names in compat.h.  These mappings will
likely be removed more quickly than other mappings in that file due to
the namespace violation.

** libgnutlsxx: Make it build when SRP is disabled.

** doc: Add doxygen files in doc/doxygen/.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crq_set_key_rsa_raw: ADDED
gnutls_session_set_finished_function: ADDED
gnutls_finished_callback_func: ADDED
GNUTLS_MASTER_SIZE: ADDED
GNUTLS_RANDOM_SIZE: ADDED
TLS_MASTER_SIZE: DEPRECATED
TLS_RANDOM_SIZE: DEPRECATED

* Version 2.5.2 (released 2008-07-08)

** libgnutls: Fix bug in gnutls_dh_params_generate2.
The prime and generator was swapped.

** libgnutls: New interface to register a new TLS extension handler.
The new function gnutls_ext_register can be used to register handlers
for specific TLS extension types.  The callback functions have the new
types gnutls_ext_recv_func and gnutls_ext_send_func.  A type to
classify TLS extensions, gnutls_ext_parse_type_t, has been added as
well.

** Move more code for TLS/IA extension from libgnutls to libgnutls-extra.
This was made possible by using the new gnutls_ext_register interface.
The TLS/IA functionality has only been supported through the
libgnutls-extra library, so it makes sense for the code to belong
there too.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_ext_recv_func: ADDED
gnutls_ext_send_func: ADDED
gnutls_ext_parse_type_t: ADDED
gnutls_ext_register: ADDED

* Version 2.5.1 (released 2008-07-02)

** Indent code.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.5.0 (released 2008-07-02)

** Port fixes from v2.4.1 release, see below.

** Added API to replace and update the crypto backend.
The header gnutls/crypto.h is now officially supported, and declares
the symbols below.

** Rewritten opencdk crypto backend, to use the gnutls internal one.

** Update gnulib and translations.
The gnulib gc crypto code has been removed since it was never finished
and is no longer even used.  An internal non-libgcrypt crypto
implementation may be added in the future, but we'll decide that later
on.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_crypto_bigint_register2: ADDED.
gnutls_crypto_cipher_register2: ADDED.
gnutls_crypto_digest_register2: ADDED.
gnutls_crypto_mac_register2: ADDED.
gnutls_crypto_pk_register2: ADDED.
gnutls_crypto_rnd_register2: ADDED.
gnutls_crypto_single_cipher_register2: ADDED.
gnutls_crypto_single_digest_register2: ADDED.
gnutls_crypto_single_mac_register2: ADDED.

* Version 2.4.3 (released 2009-02-06)

** libgnutls: Accept chains where intermediary certs are trusted.
Before GnuTLS needed to validate the entire chain back to a
self-signed certificate.  GnuTLS will now stop looking when it has
found an intermediary trusted certificate.  The new behaviour is
useful when chains, for example, contains a top-level CA, an
intermediary CA signed using RSA-MD5, and an end-entity certificate.
To avoid chain validation errors due to the RSA-MD5 cert, you can
explicitly add the intermediary RSA-MD5 cert to your trusted certs.
The signature on trusted certificates are not checked, so the chain
has a chance to validate correctly.  Reported by "Douglas E. Engert"
<deengert@anl.gov> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3351>.

** libgnutls: Permit V1 Certificate Authorities properly.
Before they were mistakenly rejected even though
GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_ANY_X509_V1_CA_CRT and/or
GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT were supplied.  Reported by
"Douglas E. Engert" <deengert@anl.gov> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3351>.

** libgnutls: deprecate X.509 validation chains using MD5 and MD2 signatures.
This is a bugfix -- the previous attempt to do this from internal x509
certificate verification procedures did not return the correct value
for certificates using a weak hash.  Reported by Daniel Kahn Gillmor
<dkg@fifthhorseman.net> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3332>,
debugged and patch by Tomas Mraz <tmraz@redhat.com> and Daniel Kahn

Andreas Metzler <ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3309>.

** libgnutls: Fix crash in X.509 validation code for self-signed certificates.
The patch to fix the security problem GNUTLS-SA-2008-3 introduced a
problem for certificate chains that contained just one self-signed
certificate.  Reported by Michael Meskes <meskes@debian.org> in
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=505279>.

** libgnutls: Fix X.509 certificate chain validation error. [GNUTLS-SA-2008-3]
The flaw makes it possible for man in the middle attackers (i.e.,
active attackers) to assume any name and trick GnuTLS clients into
trusting that name.  Thanks for report and analysis from Martin von
Gagern <Martin.vGagern@gmx.net>.  [CVE-2008-4989]

** libgnutls: Fix local crash in gnutls_handshake.  [GNUTLS-SA-2008-2]
If the gnutls_handshake function is called for a normal session, which
can happen for re-handshakes, the library would crash because it tried
to hash some data using a libgcrypt handle that had been deallocated.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.4.0 (released 2008-06-19)

** Major changes compared to the v2.2 branch:

*** The OpenPGP sub-system has been improved and now supports subkeys.

*** The PSK sub-system has been improved and now supports password
*** derivation and PSK identity hints.
The password derivation algorithms support is documented in
draft-ietf-netconf-tls-02.txt.

*** The certtool --inder and --outder has been replaced by --inraw and --outraw.
This aligns terminology with OpenPGP, which doesn't use DER encoding.
The old parameters will continue to work for some time.

*** Certtool now confirm passwords and changes permissions of private key files.

*** The default handshake size limit has been increased to 48kb.
It appears as if some valid handshakes are large due to sending many
CA certificates.  (The earlier limit was 16kb.)

*** LZO compression is now disabled by default.
The main reason is that LZO compression in TLS is not standardized,
but license compatiblity issues with minilzo triggered us to make this
decision now.

*** Improvements for cross-compilation to Windows and OpenWRT.

*** The look of the GTK-DOC manual has been improved.
Major developer visible changes compared to the v2.2 branch:

*** Full OpenPGP support is part of libgnutls, licensed under the LGPL.

*** New APIs to access the raw X.509 Subject and Issuer DN's and
*** elements from the certificate credentials structure.
Thanks to Joe Orton.

*** New APIs to improve working with username/passwords and PSK.

*** Names of constants to affect certificate printing changed.
The constants are used for OpenPGP too, which the names didn't
reflect, so the following name change has been made:

            Old name                         New name
     GNUTLS_X509_CRT_FULL            GNUTLS_CRT_PRINT_FULL
     GNUTLS_X509_CRT_ONELINE         GNUTLS_CRT_PRINT_ONELINE
     GNUTLS_X509_CRT_UNSIGNED_FULL   GNUTLS_CRT_PRINT_UNSIGNED_FULL

The old names will be mapped to the new names for some time.

*** The function gnutls_openpgp_privkey_get_id has been renamed to
*** gnutls_openpgp_privkey_get_key_id.
A compatibility mapping exists to avoid breaking API backwards
compatibility.

*** Replaced all uses of alloca with malloc and free.

*** We no longer build with -D_REENTRANT -D_THREAD_SAFE.
We have been unable to find a documented rationale for this practice.

*** Of course, many smaller fixes have been made, see the ChangeLog file.

*** API/ABI changes in GnuTLS 2.4
All OpenPGP related functions have been moved from libgnutls-extra to
libgnutls, and several new functions have been added (see below).
Before making the release, we discussed whether moving functions from
libgnutls-extra to libgnutls would require us to increment the ABI
version, but the general opinion was that this would not be required.
All older functions continue to work the same.  We are open to the
possibility that this decision will lead to problem on some platform,
and if it turns out that the Right Thing should have been to increment
the shared library version, we would need to release an update within
the 2.4.x branch that increments the shared library version.

This release adds the following functions:

  gnutls_psk_client_get_hint
  gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_hint
  gnutls_psk_netconf_derive_key

    Used to get/set the PSK identity hint, and derive PSK keys from
    passwords a'la netconf.

  gnutls_x509_dn_deinit
  gnutls_x509_dn_export
  gnutls_x509_dn_import
  gnutls_x509_dn_init

    Used to handle X.509 Certificate DN's directly.

  gnutls_hex2bin

    Converts a data buffer to hex.  Useful for handling PSK/SRP shared
    secrets.

  gnutls_certificate_get_x509_cas
  gnutls_certificate_get_x509_crls
  gnutls_certificate_get_openpgp_keyring

    Functions for direct access to credential elements.

  gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_auth_subkey

    New OpenPGP related functions.

    The function gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_key_id is the same as the old
    from gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_id, see above.

The release also adds a new header file 'gnutls/crypto.h', however it
is currently not used.

** libgnutls [OpenPGP]: New APIs to retrieve fingerprint from OpenPGP subkeys.
Contributed by Daniel Kahn Gillmor <dkg-debian.org@fifthhorseman.net>.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_subkey_fingerprint: ADDED.
gnutls_openpgp_privkey_get_subkey_fingerprint: ADDED.

* Version 2.3.15 (released 2008-06-15)

** Disable the openpgp-certs self-tests.
It results in failure under Wine and doesn't work on Debian buildds.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.3.14 (released 2008-06-11)

** libgnutls [OpenPGP]: Changed OpenPGP verification behaviour.
An OpenPGP certificate is now only considered verified if all the user
IDs are verified.

** Examples: Make C++ example compile.
Earlier it may have failed with an unresolved reference to strlen.

** Documentation: Doc fix for gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_oid.
Reported by Sam Varshavchik <mrsam@courier-mta.com>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.3.13 (released 2008-06-07)

** libgnutls [OpenPGP]: Make OpenPGP handshakes work again.

** doc/: Add psktool to info index.  Some minor cleanups.

** tests/: Added non-forking TLS handshake test, see tests/mini.c.

** tests/: Added libgcrypt.supp which can be used with valgrind.
The file suppresses the known libgcrypt memory leaks, so they aren't
printed when you run valgrind on the gnutls self-tests.  Use it as
follows: valgrind --suppressions=libgcrypt.supp ./x509self or add
'--suppressions=/home/you/src/gnutls/tests/libgcrypt.supp' to your
~/.valgrindrc file.

** tests/: Reduce amount of debugging output by default.
Use --verbose for each test to get the full output.

** tests/: Fix memory leaks in several self-tests.
None of the self tests should be leaking memory when running valgrind
or similar tools.  (Known exceptions are dhepskself, pskself, and
set_pkcs12_cred, which appear likely to be due to memory leaks in the
library.)

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.3.12 (released 2008-06-04)

** Merge gnutls_with_netconf branch.

*** libgnutls [PSK]: New API to retrieve PSK identity hint in client.
The function is gnutls_psk_client_get_hint.

*** libgnutls [PSK]: New API to set PSK identity hint in server.
The function is gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_hint.

*** libgnutls [PSK]: Support server key exchange with PSK identity hint.
In the client, the message is parsed and the application can use
gnutls_psk_client_get_hint to retrieve the hint.  In the server, the
message is sent if the application has specified a PSK identity hint
using gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_hint.

*** libgnutls [PSK]: Support Netconf PSK key derivation.
The function gnutls_psk_netconf_derive_key supports the PSK key
derivation as specified in draft-ietf-netconf-tls-02.txt.  New self
test netconf-psk.c.

*** psktool: Support new --netconf-hint to generate PSK key from password.
Uses the Netconf algorithm to derive PSK key from password.

*** gnutls-serv: Support new --pskhint parameter to set PSK identity hint.

*** gnutls-cli: Always support PSK modes, through a callback.
The callback will derive a PSK key using Netconf algorithm.  It will
print the PSK identity hint to help the user.

*** New PSK example client and server.
See doc/examples/ex-client-psk.c and doc/examples/ex-serv-psk.c.

** libgnutls: Fix gnutls_x509_crl_set_version on arm platforms.
The code didn't work properly on platforms where 'char' is unsigned,
when you set version 0.  Reported by Laurence Withers
<l@lwithers.me.uk> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/2825>.

** libgnutls-openssl: added RAND_pseudo_bytes API.
Patch from Robert Millan <rmh@aybabtu.com>.

** API and ABI modifications:
RAND_pseudo_bytes: ADDED to libgnutls-openssl.
gnutls_psk_client_get_hint: ADDED.
gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_hint: ADDED.
gnutls_psk_netconf_derive_key: ADDED

* Version 2.3.11 (released 2008-05-20)

** Fix flaw in fix for GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-3.
The flaw would result in incorrectly terminated sessions with the
error "Decryption has failed" when the server sends a small packet
(typically when the session is closed).  Reported by Andreas Metzler
<ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/2807>.

** Don't use gnulib headers when building C++ library.
Fixes builds under Windows.

** Make umask a requirement.
We don't know of any system that lacks it, even GNU CoreUtils use it
unconditionally.

** Update gnulib files.
Fixes a problem where it pulled in a replacement for memcmp under
MinGW, which caused the C++ example to fail to build.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.3.10 (released 2008-05-19)

** Added wide wildcard hostname matching.
Tiny patch by Jean-Philippe Garcia Ballester.

** Fix three security vulnerabilities.  [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1]
Thanks to CERT-FI for finding the bugs and providing detailed reports,
which allowed the bugs to be reproduced and fixed easily.  Patches
developed by Simon Josefsson and Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos.  Any updates
with more details about these vulnerabilities will be added to
<https://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html>

*** [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-1]
*** libgnutls: Fix crash when sending invalid server name.
The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can
lead to a Daniel of Service attack to disable the server.  The bug
cause gnutls to store more session resumption data than what was
allocated for, thus overwriting unallocated memory.

*** [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-2]
*** libgnutls: Fix crash when sending repeated client hellos.
The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can
lead to a Daniel of Service attack to disable the server.  The bug
triggers a null-pointer dereference.

*** [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-3]
*** libgnutls: Fix crash in cipher padding decoding for invalid record lengths.
The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can
lead to a Daniel of Service attack to disable the server.  The bug
cause gnutls to read memory beyond the end of the received record.

** libgnutlsxx: Updated API according to patches from Eduardo
Villanueva Che (discussion at
<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnutls-devel/2007-02/msg00017.html>)

** Use umask to restrict permissions to owner before creating a file.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.3.9 (released 2008-05-16)

** libgnutls: Fix build failures if SRP/OpenPGP is disabled.
Based on report and tiny patches from
<jared.jennings.ctr@eglin.af.mil>, see
<https://savannah.gnu.org/support/index.php?106342>.

** libgnutls: Translation fixes.

** gnutls-cli: Fix so that PSK authentication works.
Also improve manual to give example for gnutls-cli PSK authentication.

** certtool: Encrypting a private key now require a confirmed password.
Before './certtool -k -8' would merely ask for a password once.
Reported by Daniel 'NebuchadnezzaR' Dehennin
<nebuchadnezzar@asgardr.info> see
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=364287>.

** certtool: When writing private keys to files, change permissions of file.
Now the file which the private key is saved to is chmod'ed 0600.
Reported by martin f krafft <madduck@debian.org> see
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=373169>.

** guile: Fix -fgnu89-inline test.

** Removed --enable-profile-mode.
The code linked gnutls with the libfc project (Function Check) which
appears to have been stalled since around 2002.

** Clean up header file checks by ./configure.

** Update of gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.3.8 (released 2008-04-29)

** libgnutls: Increase default handshake packet size limit to 48kb.
The old limit was 16kb and some servers send huge list of trusted CAs,
thus running into the limit.  FYI, applications can further increase
this limit using gnutls_handshake_set_max_packet_length.  Thanks to
Marc Haber <mh+debian-bugs@zugschlus.de> and "Marc F. Clemente"
<marc@mclemente.net> for reporting and providing test servers.

** libgnutls: Add new error code: GNUTLS_E_HANDSHAKE_TOO_LARGE
Returned when the handshake data size is too large.  Before
GNUTLS_E_MEMORY_ERROR was used, which could be confused with other
error situations.

** libgnutls: Hide definitions in crypto.h.
We have decided that the APIs defined in crypto.h are not stable
enough for v2.4, so don't use any of those functions.

** gnutls-cli: exit when hostname doesn't match certificate.
Use --insecure to avoid hostname comparison.

** certtool: --inder and --outder replaced by --inraw and --outraw.
The reason is to align terminology with OpenPGP, which doesn't use
DER.  The old parameters will continue to work for some time.

** doc: Add section 'Index of new symbols in 2.4.0' to the GTK-DOC manual.

** doc: Many cosmetic fixes, to silence (most) gtk-doc warnings.

** Mingw32: Revert libgcrypt vasprintf work-around added in last release.
Use libgcrypt 1.4.1 or later when building on MinGW32, it removes the
vasprintf symbol from the libgcrypt library which caused problems.

** Update of gnulib files.

** tests: New self-test of crypto.h RNG code tests/crypto_rng.

** API and ABI modifications:
GNUTLS_E_HANDSHAKE_TOO_LARGE: ADDED.

* Version 2.3.7 (released 2008-04-21)

** opencdk now properly sets the key usage bits into openpgp keys.

** gnutls-cli: Fix crash on TLS handshake failures.
Reported by "Marc F. Clemente" <marc@mclemente.net> in Debian BTS #466477.
This is similar to <http://bugs.debian.org/429183>.

** certtool: with --generate-request and newly generated keys, print the key.

** Build fixes for MinGW.
Missing rpl_fseeko symbol in lib/opencdk/.  Better checks for linking
with -lws2_32 when needed.  Use ASCII only isprint() when printing
X.509 certificate information, to avoid non-ASCII but printable
characters.  Thanks to Massimo Gaspari <massimo.gaspari@alice.it> for
reports.

** Update internal copy of libtasn1 to version 1.4.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.3.6 (released 2008-04-17)

** Make gnutls_x509_crq_sign2 set certificate request version if not set.
** Improve documentation for gnutls_x509_crq_sign2.
Based on report from "John Brooks" <aspecialj@gmail.com> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.network.gnutls.general/1154>.

** tests/pathlen: run diff without parameters to improve portability.
Based on HPUX build hints in

** Don't use %e specifier with strftime, it doesn't work under Windows.
Reported by Massimo Gaspari <massimo.gaspari@alice.it> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.network.gnutls.general/1170>.

** Remove all uses of gnutls_alloca/gnutls_afree.
Use normal gnutls_malloc instead.  One reason is increased portability
to Windows, the other is that several of the uses may be unsafe
because the size of data allocated could be large.  Reported by
Massimo Gaspari <massimo.gaspari@alice.it> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.network.gnutls.general/1170>.

** Build Guile code with -fgnu89-inline only when supported.
Reported by Kris Karas <ktk@enterprise.bidmc.harvard.edu> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/2708>.

** Several GTK-DOC related fixes.

** Clean up OpenCDK related code.
GnuTLS now requires its internal OpenCDK code rather than the external
GPL library OpenCDK.  Unfortunately, we don't have resources to
maintain an external library (help welcome).

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.3.5 (released 2008-04-14)

* Version 2.3.3 (released 2008-03-10)

** Fix build failure in libextra/gnutls_extra.c that needed opencdk.h.
Reported by Roman Bogorodskiy <novel@FreeBSD.org>.

** No longer compiled using -D_REENTRANT -D_THREAD_SAFE.
We could not find any modern justification for enabling these flags by
default.  If you know of some platform that needs one of the flags to
work properly, please let us know.  (Actually introduced in v2.3.0 but
not documented until now.)

** Importing many CA certificates are now considerably faster.
This affect gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_mem,
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust, and
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_file.  The complexity was reduced
from O(2*n^2) to O(n).  When adding 206 files containing 408
certificates, using gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_file, the time
dropped from 40 seconds to 0.3 seconds.  Thanks to Edgar Fuß for code
to trigger the problem.  See also
<http://blog.josefsson.org/2008/02/27/real-world-performance-tuning-with-callgrind/>.

gnutls_certificate_export_openpgp_keyring: RENAMED to gnutls_certificate_get_openpgp_keyring
gnutls_x509_dn_export: ADDED

* Version 2.3.1 (released 2008-02-21)

** OpenPGP support merged into libgnutls and is now licensed under LGPL.
The included copy of OpenCDK has been stripped down and re-licensed
under the LGPL.

** Cipher priority string handling now handle strings that starts with NULL.
Thanks to Laurence Withers <l@lwithers.me.uk>.

** gnutls-cli: When -d is used, also prints RNG information from libgcrypt.

* Version 2.3.0 (released 2008-01-08)

** LZO compression is now disabled by default.
The reason is that LZO compression is not standardized in TLS.  If you
wish to experiment with it, you will have to supply --with-lzo when
invoking ./configure.  The internal copy of minilzo is no longer
included with GnuTLS, so you will need to install liblzo or liblzo2 on
your system to have --with-lzo to be effective.

** More than one server name field is now sent to the server properly.
Thanks to mark.phillips@virgin.net.

** Fixes the post_client_hello_function(). The extensions are now parsed
in a callback friendly way.

** Fix for certificate selection in servers with certificate callbacks.

** Updated translations.

** Update gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.2.5 (released 2008-05-19)

** Fix flaw in fix for GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-3.
The flaw would result in incorrectly terminated sessions with the
error "Decryption has failed" when the server sends a small packet
(typically when the session is closed).  Reported by Andreas Metzler
<ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/2807>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.2.4 (released 2008-05-19)

** Fix three security vulnerabilities.  [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1]
Thanks to CERT-FI for finding the bugs and providing detailed reports,
which allowed the bugs to be reproduced and fixed easily.  Patches
developed by Simon Josefsson and Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos.  Any updates
with more details about these vulnerabilities will be added to
<https://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html>

*** [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-1]
*** libgnutls: Fix crash when sending invalid server name.
The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can
lead to a Daniel of Service attack to disable the server.  The bug
cause gnutls to store more session resumption data than what was
allocated for, thus overwriting unallocated memory.

*** [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-2]
*** libgnutls: Fix crash when sending repeated client hellos.
The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can
lead to a Daniel of Service attack to disable the server.  The bug
triggers a null-pointer dereference.

*** [GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-3]
*** libgnutls: Fix crash in cipher padding decoding for invalid record lengths.
The crash can be triggered remotely before authentication, which can
lead to a Daniel of Service attack to disable the server.  The bug
cause gnutls to read memory beyond the end of the received record.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.2.3 (released 2008-05-06)

** Increase default handshake packet size limit to 48kb.
The old limit was 16kb and some servers send huge list of trusted CAs,
thus running into the limit.  FYI, applications can further increase
this limit using gnutls_handshake_set_max_packet_length.  Thanks to
Marc Haber <mh+debian-bugs@zugschlus.de> and "Marc F. Clemente"
<marc@mclemente.net> for reporting and providing test servers.

** Fix compilation error related to __FUNCTION__ on some systems.
Reported by Tim Mooney, see
<https://savannah.gnu.org/support/?106267>.

** Documented the --priority option to gnutls-cli and gnutls-serv.

** Fix fopen file descriptor leak in PSK server code.
Thanks to Laurence Withers <l@lwithers.me.uk>, see
<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnutls-devel/2008-04/msg00002.html>.

Reported by Kris Karas <ktk@enterprise.bidmc.harvard.edu> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/2708>.

** Make Camellia encryption work.
Reported by Yoshisato YANAGISAWA <yanagisawa@csg.is.titech.ac.jp> in

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.2.2 (released 2008-02-21)

** Cipher priority string handling now handle strings that starts with NULL.
Thanks to Laurence Withers <l@lwithers.me.uk>.

** Corrected memory leaks in session resuming and DHE ciphersuites. Reported
by Daniel Stenberg.

** Increased the default certificate verification chain limits and allowed
for checks without limitation.

** Corrected the behaviour of gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name()
and gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name() to not null terminate binary
strings and return the proper size.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.2.1 (released 2008-01-17)

** Prevent linking libextra against previously installed libgnutls.
Tiny patch from "Alon Bar-Lev" <alon.barlev@gmail.com>, see
<http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=202269>.

** Fixes the post_client_hello_function(). The extensions are now parsed
in a callback friendly way.

** Fix for certificate selection in servers with certificate callbacks.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.2.0 (released 2007-12-14)

** Update internal copy of libtasn1 to version 1.2.

** Certtool --verify-chain now handle inputs larger than 64kb.
This fixes the self-test "rsa-md5-collision" under MinGW+Wine with
recent versions of libgcrypt.  The problem was that Wine with the
libgcrypt RNG generates huge amounts of debugging output.

** Translation updates.
Added Dutch translation.  Updated Polish and Swedish translation.

** Major changes compared to the v2.0 branch:

*** SRP support aligned with newly published RFC 5054.

*** OpenPGP support aligned with newly published RFC 5081.

*** Support for DSA2 keys.

*** Support for Camellia cipher.

*** Support for Opaque PRF Input extension.

*** PKCS#8 parser now handle DSA keys.

*** Change from GPLv2 to GPLv3 for command-line tools, libgnutls-extra, etc.
Notice that liblzo2 2.02 is licensed under GPLv2 only.  Earlier
versions, such as 2.01 which is included with GnuTLS, is available
under GPLv2 or later.  If this incompatibility causes problems, we
recommend you to disable LZO using --without-lzo.  LZO compression is
not a standard TLS compression algorithm, so the impact should be
minimal.

*** Functions for disabling record protocol padding.
Works around bugs on Nokia/Ericsson phones.

*** New functions gnutls_priority_set() for setting cipher priorities easily.
Priorities like "COMPAT" also enables other work arounds, such as
disabling padding.

*** Other minor improvements and bug fixes.

** Backwards incompatible API/ABI changes in GnuTLS 2.2
To adapt to changes in the TLS extension specifications for OpenPGP
and SRP, the GnuTLS API had to be modified.  This means breaking the
API and ABI backwards compatibility.  That is something we try to
avoid unless it is necessary.  We decided to also remove the already
deprecated stub functions for X.509 to XML conversion and TLS
authorization (see below) when we had the opportunity.

Generally, most applications does not need to be modified.  Just
re-compile them against the latest GnuTLS release, and it should work
fine.

Applications that use the OpenPGP or SRP features needs to be
modified.  Below is a list of the modified APIs and discussion of what
the minimal things you need to modify in your application to make it
work with GnuTLS 2.2.

Note that GnuTLS 2.2 also introduces new APIs -- such as
gnutls_set_priority() that is superior to
gnutls_set_default_priority() -- that you may want to start using.
However, using those new APIs is not required to use GnuTLS 2.2 since
the old functions continue are still supported.  This text only
discuss what you minimally have to modify.

*** XML related changes
The function `gnutls_x509_crt_to_xml' has been removed.  It has been
deprecated and only returned an error code since GnuTLS version
1.2.11.  Nobody has complained, so users doesn't seem to miss the
functionality.  We don't know of any other library to convert X.509
certificates into XML format, but we decided (long ago) that GnuTLS
isn't the right place for this kind of functionality.  If you want
help to find some other library to use here, please explain and
discuss your use case on help-gnutls@gnu.org.

*** TLS Authorization related changes
Everything related to TLS authorizations have been removed, they were
only stub functions that returned an error code:

 GNUTLS_SUPPLEMENTAL_AUTHZ_DATA
 gnutls_authz_data_format_type_t
 gnutls_authz_recv_callback_func
 gnutls_authz_send_callback_func
 gnutls_authz_enable
 gnutls_authz_send_x509_attr_cert
 gnutls_authz_send_saml_assertion
 gnutls_authz_send_x509_attr_cert_url
 gnutls_authz_send_saml_assertion_url

*** SRP related changes
The callback gnutls_srp_client_credentials_function has a new
prototype, and its semantic has changed.  You need to rewrite the
callback, see the updated function documentation and SRP example code
(doc/examples/ex-client-srp.c and doc/examples/ex-serv-srp.c) for more
information.

The alert codes GNUTLS_A_MISSING_SRP_USERNAME and
GNUTLS_A_UNKNOWN_SRP_USERNAME are no longer used by the SRP
specification, instead the GNUTLS_A_UNKNOWN_PSK_IDENTITY alert is
used.  There are #define's to map the old names to the new.  You may
run into problems if you have a switch-case with cases for both SRP
alerts, since they are now mapped to the same value.  The solution is
to drop the SRP alerts from such switch cases, as they are now
deprecated in favor of GNUTLS_A_UNKNOWN_PSK_IDENTITY.

*** OpenPGP related changes
The function `gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_keyserver' have been
removed.  There is no replacement functionality inside GnuTLS.  If you
need keyserver functionality, consider using the GnuPG tools.

All functions, types, and error codes related to OpenPGP trustdb
format have been removed.  The trustdb format is a non-standard
GnuPG-specific format, and we recommend you to use key rings instead.
The following have been removed:

 gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_trustdb
 gnutls_openpgp_trustdb_init
 gnutls_openpgp_trustdb_deinit
 gnutls_openpgp_trustdb_import
 gnutls_openpgp_key_verify_trustdb
 gnutls_openpgp_trustdb_t
 GNUTLS_E_OPENPGP_TRUSTDB_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED

The following functions has an added parameter of the (new) type
`gnutls_openpgp_crt_fmt_t'.  The type specify the format of the data
(binary or base64).  The functions are:
 gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_key_file
 gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_key_mem
 gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_keyring_mem
 gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_keyring_file

To improve terminology and align with the X.509 interface, some
functions have been renamed.  Compatibility mappings exists.  The old
and new names of the affected functions and types are:

        Old name                                New name
 gnutls_openpgp_key_t                    gnutls_openpgp_crt_t
 gnutls_openpgp_key_fmt_t                gnutls_openpgp_crt_fmt_t
 gnutls_openpgp_key_status_t             gnutls_openpgp_crt_status_t
 GNUTLS_OPENPGP_KEY                      GNUTLS_OPENPGP_CERT
 GNUTLS_OPENPGP_KEY_FINGERPRINT          GNUTLS_OPENPGP_CERT_FINGERPRINT

 gnutls_openpgp_key_export               gnutls_openpgp_crt_export
 gnutls_openpgp_key_get_key_usage        gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_key_usage
 gnutls_openpgp_key_get_fingerprint      gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_fingerprint
 gnutls_openpgp_key_get_pk_algorithm     gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_pk_algorithm
 gnutls_openpgp_key_get_name             gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_name
 gnutls_openpgp_key_get_version          gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_version
 gnutls_openpgp_key_get_creation_time    gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_creation_time
 gnutls_openpgp_key_get_expiration_time  gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_expiration_time
 gnutls_openpgp_key_get_id               gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_id
 gnutls_openpgp_key_check_hostname       gnutls_openpgp_crt_check_hostname
 gnutls_openpgp_send_key                 gnutls_openpgp_send_cert

During the 2.1.x series the GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_HASH_ALGORITHM error code
was renamed to GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_ALGORITHM, unfortunately without being
documented.  This caused some problems (e.g., debian #450854).  To
avoid backwards compatibility problems, this release revert this
change, so that GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_HASH_ALGORITHM works just like it has
done in GnuTLS 2.0.x and earlier, and add a new error code
GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_ALGORITHM.

** Fixes several gtk-doc warnings.

** API and ABI modifications:
GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_ALGORITHM: CHANGED.
GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_HASH_ALGORITHM: CHANGED.
GNUTLS_E_BASE64_UNEXPECTED_HEADER_ERROR: ADD.

* Version 2.1.5 (released 2007-11-01)

** Fix PKCS#3 parameter export problem.

** Improve certtool queries, they now print the default value.

** Fix ABI version.

** Update gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.1.4 (released 2007-10-27)

** Added the --v1 option to certtool, to allow generating X.509
version 1 certificates.

** certtool: Add option --disable-quick-random to enable the old behaviour
of using /dev/random to generate keys.

** Added priority functions that accept strings.

** Added gnutls_set_default_priority2() which accepts a flag to indicate
priorities preferences.

** Added gnutls_record_disable_padding() to allow servers talking to
buggy clients that complain if the TLS 1.0 record protocol padding is
used.

** Introduced gnutls_session_enable_compatibility_mode() to allow enabling
all supported compatibility options (like disabling padding).

** The gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_* functions were modified to include
the format. This makes the interface consistent with the x509 functions.

** Internal copy of OpenCDK upgraded to version 0.6.5.

** Update gnulib files.

* Version 2.1.3 (released 2007-10-17)

** TLS authorization support removed.
This technique may be patented in the future, and it is not of crucial
importance for the Internet community.  After deliberation we have
concluded that the best thing we can do in this situation is to
encourage society not to adopt this technique.  We have decided to
lead the way with our own actions.

** Re-enabled the 256 bit ciphers in the default priorities.

** Corrected bugs in openpgp key verification using a keyring (both in
gnutls and opencdk)

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_keyserver: REMOVED
gnutls_authz_data_format_type_t,
gnutls_authz_recv_callback_func,
gnutls_authz_send_callback_func,
gnutls_authz_enable,
gnutls_authz_send_x509_attr_cert,
gnutls_authz_send_saml_assertion,
gnutls_authz_send_x509_attr_cert_url,
gnutls_authz_send_saml_assertion_url: REMOVED.
GNUTLS_SUPPLEMENTAL_USER_MAPPING_DATA: ADDED.  To avoid that the
    gnutls_supplemental_data_format_type_t enum type becomes empty.

* Version 2.1.2 (released 2007-10-14)

** Removed all the trustdb code from openpgp authentication.
We now use only the well-specified keyrings.

** The 256 bit ciphers are not enabled in the default priorities.

** Added support for DSA2 using libgcrypt 1.3.0.

** certtool: Fixed data corruption when using --outder.

** Removed all the xml related stubs and functions.

** Added capability to set a callback after the client hello is received
by the server in order to adjust parameters before the handshake.

** SRP was corrected to adhere to the latest draft (published soon as RFC)

** Corrected bug which did not allow a server to run without supporting
certificates.

** Updated the DN parser which now prints wrongly decoded values as hex
strings.

** certtool: Add option --quick-random.
For generating low security test credentials.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crt_to_xml: REMOVED
gnutls_openpgp_key_to_xml: REMOVED

GNUTLS_A_MISSING_SRP_USERNAME: DEPRECATED
GNUTLS_A_UNKNOWN_SRP_USERNAME: DEPRECATED

* Version 2.1.1 (released 2007-09-24)

** Added support for Camellia cipher, thanks to Yoshisato YANAGISAWA.
Camellia is only enabled in GnuTLS if the installed libgcrypt has been
compiled with Camellia support.  See the libgcrypt documentation on
how to enable it.  Unconditionally disable it using the configure
option --disable-camellia.  Fixes #1.

** Properly document in the NEWS file the API change in the last release.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.1.0 (released 2007-09-20)

** Support for draft-rescorla-tls-opaque-prf-input-00.txt.
The support is disabled by default.  Since no value has been allocated
by the IANA for this extension yet, you will need to provide one
yourself by invoking './configure --enable-opaque-prf-input=42'.
Fixes #2.

** Example code: Fix compilation flaw under MinGW.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_oprfi_callback_func: ADD, new typedef function prototype.
gnutls_oprfi_enable_client: ADD, new function.
gnutls_oprfi_enable_server: ADD, new function.

* Version 2.0.4 (released 2007-11-16)

** Corrected bug in decompression of expanded compression data.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.0.3 (released 2007-11-10)

** This version backports several fixes from the 2.1.x branch.

** Fixed PKCS #3 parameter export.

** Added gnutls_record_disable_padding() to allow servers talking to
buggy clients that complain if the TLS 1.0 record protocol padding is
used.

** Introduced gnutls_session_enable_compatibility_mode() to allow enabling
all supported compatibility options (like disabling padding).

** Corrected bug which did not allow a server to run without supporting
certificates.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_session_enable_compatibility_mode: ADDED
gnutls_record_disable_padding: ADDED

* Version 2.0.2 (released 2007-10-17)

** TLS authorization support removed.
This technique may be patented in the future, and it is not of crucial
importance for the Internet community.  After deliberation we have
concluded that the best thing we can do in this situation is to
encourage society not to adopt this technique.  We have decided to
lead the way with our own actions.

** certtool: Fixed data corruption when using --outder.

** Fix configure-time Guile detection.

** API and ABI modifications:
GNUTLS_SUPPLEMENTAL_USER_MAPPING_DATA: ADDED.  To avoid that the
    gnutls_supplemental_data_format_type_t enum type becomes empty.

* Version 2.0.1 (released 2007-09-20)

** New directory doc/credentials/ with test credentials.
This collects the test credentials from the web page and from src/.
The script gnutls-http-serv has also been moved to that directory.

** Update SRP extension type and cipher suite with official IANA values.
This breaks backwards compatibility with SRP in older versions of
GnuTLS, but this is intentional to speed up the adoption of the
official values.  The old values we used were incorrect.

** Guile: Fix `x509-certificate-dn-oid'

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 2.0.0 (released 2007-09-04)

** Included copy of Libtasn1 upgraded to version 1.1.

** Disable building of some examples if anonymous ciphers are disabled.

** Don't build examples for disabled features.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.7.19 (released 2007-08-27)

** Fix gnutls_error_is_fatal so that positive "errors" are non-critical.
This solves connection problems in mutt, see
<http://bugs.debian.org/439640>.

** Update gnulib files.
In particular, the getpass module -- with its dependencies on getline,
getdelim, fseeko etc -- where moved from the lgl/ (used by the core
library) directory to the gl/ directory (only used by the command line
tools).  The reason is that getpass is now only used by the
command-line tools, and reducing the number of gnulib modules linked
to the core library helps portability and reduces size.

** Fix warnings.

** Disable building of PGP examples if PGP is disabled.

** Included copy of OpenCDK upgraded to version 0.6.4.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.7.18 (released 2007-08-16)

** Install images for the info manual.
This has a side effect of renaming the images.  See
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.tex.texinfo.bugs/3533> for
discussions on the approach chosen.

** Fix pointer mix to variables of different size.
Patch extracted from
<http://cvs.fedora.redhat.com/viewcvs/devel/gnutls/gnutls-1.6.3-incompat-pointers.patch?rev=1.1&view=auto>.

** Fix warnings during build.
Thanks to Andreas Metzler <ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.7.17 (released 2007-08-15)

** New functions to perform external signing.
Set the signing callback function (of the gnutls_sign_func prototype)
using the gnutls_sign_callback_set function.  In the callback, you may
find the new functions gnutls_x509_privkey_sign_hash and
gnutls_openpgp_privkey_sign_hash useful.  A new function
gnutls_sign_callback_get is also added, to retrieve the function
pointer.  Thanks to "Alon Bar-Lev" <alon.barlev@gmail.com> for
comments and testing.

** New self test of client and server authenticated X.509 TLS sessions.
See tests/x509self.c and tests/x509signself.c.  The latter also tests
the new external signing callback interface.

** New errors GNUTLS_E_APPLICATION_ERROR_MIN..GNUTLS_E_APPLICATION_ERROR_MAX.
These two actually describe the outer limits of a range of error codes
reserved to the application.  All of the errors are treated as fatal
by the library (it has to since it doesn't know the semantics of the
error codes).  This can be useful in callbacks, to signal some
application-specific error condition, which will usually eventually
cause some gnutls API to return the same error code as the callback,
which then can be inspected by the application.  Note that error codes
are negative.

** gnutls_set_default_priority now disable TLS 1.2 by default.
The RFC is not released yet, and we're approaching a major release so
let's not enable it just yet.

** Fix namespace so that gnutls_*_t is used consistently.
Before, many places in the GnuTLS code used the old deprecated type
names without the '_t' suffix.

** Build fixes for Guile code.
Patch from Ludovic Courtes <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>.

** More documentation fixes.
In particular, the section headings were modified for casing.  By
Ludovic Courtes <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>.

** Updated Polish and Swedish translations.
Thanks to Jakub Bogusz <qboosh@pld-linux.org> and Daniel Nylander
<po@danielnylander.se>.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_sign_func: ADD, new type for sign callback.
gnutls_sign_callback_set: ADD, new function to set sign callback.
gnutls_sign_callback_get: ADD, new function to retrieve sign callback.
gnutls_x509_privkey_sign_hash,
gnutls_openpgp_privkey_sign_hash: ADD, new functions useful in sign callback.
GNUTLS_E_APPLICATION_ERROR_MIN,
GNUTLS_E_APPLICATION_ERROR_MAX: ADD, new CPP #defines for error codes.

* Version 1.7.16 (released 2007-08-07)

** Fix sanity checks and return values in certificate selection.
In some cases, GnuTLS omitted to report suitable error codes when no
suitable certificate was found.

** Fix gnutls-cli starttls EOF on Mac OS X.
Thanks to Hal Eden <n.mavrogiannopoulos@gmail.com>.

** Documentation fixes.
In particular, the section headings were modified for casing.  By
Ludovic Courtes <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>.

** Update gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.7.15 (released 2007-07-02)

** Fix self-tests key-id under mingw32.

** Test that the Guile header files are recent enough to work.
Before we just tested that the command line tool 'guile' was recent
enough, which may not be sufficient if you still have an old
libguile.h header installed.

** Guile bindings are now installed under $prefix by default.
Use --without-guile-site-dir to install it under $pkgdatadir/site/
where $pkgdatadir is as returned by "guile-config info pkgdatadir".
Use --with-guile-site-dir=/your/own/path to specify the path manually.
The default, --with-guile-site-dir, will install the Guile bindings
under $datadir/guile/site.  There is a new section 'Guile
Preparations' in the manual that discuss these issues.

** Fix run-time library path ordering in linking the Guile bindings.

** Improved manual on downloading, installing, getting help, bug reports etc.
Suggested by Ludovic Courtès <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>.

** Add Malay message translations.
Thanks to Sharuzzaman Ahmat Raslan <sharuzzaman@myrealbox.com>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.7.14 (released 2007-06-26)

** Don't enable Guile bindings unless we have Guile 1.8 or later.
Patch from Ludovic Courtès <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>.

** Fix memory leak during DSA signature verification.
Patch from Ludovic Courtès <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>.

** Fix crash in gnutls-cli when TLS handshake fails.
Reported by Marc Haber <mh+debian-bugs@zugschlus.de> and Andreas
Metzler <ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org> via Debian BTS #429183, see
<http://bugs.debian.org/429183>.

** Minor OpenPGP fixes in stream_to_datum.
Patch from Timo Schulz <twoaday@freakmail.de> and Ludovic Courtès
<ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>.

** Fix off-by-one in TLS 1.2 handshake.
Patch from Ludovic Courtès <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>.

* Version 1.7.12 (released 2007-06-08)

** Guile bindings for GnuTLS have been included.
Contributed by Ludovic Courtès <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr>.  There is a
new chapter 'Guile Bindings' in the manual.

** Have PKCS8 parser return better error codes.
Reported by Nate Nielsen <nielsen-list@memberwebs.com>, see
<http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnutls-dev/2007-May/001653.html> and
<http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnutls-dev/2007-May/001654.html>.

** Fix mem leak for sessions with client authentication via certificates.
Reported by Andrew W. Nosenko <andrew.w.nosenko@gmail.com>, see
<http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnutls-dev/2007-April/001539.html>.

** Fix mem leaks.
Reported by Dennis Vshivkov <walrus@amur.ru>, see
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=333050>.  Added
self-test tests/parse_ca.c to test regressions.

** Fix build failures related to missing images in manual.
Reported by Andreas Metzler <ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org>.

** Update gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.7.11 (released 2007-05-26)

** Include opencdk.h in the release.
Reported by Roman Bogorodskiy <novel@FreeBSD.org>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.7.10 (released 2007-05-25)

** New API functions to extract DER encoded X.509 Subject/Issuer DN.
Suggested by Nate Nielsen <nielsen-list@memberwebs.com>.

** Update of gnulib files.

** GnuTLS is now developed in GIT instead of CVS.
See <http://repo.or.cz/w/gnutls.git> for a public repository.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crt_get_raw_issuer_dn: ADD.
gnutls_x509_crt_get_raw_dn: ADD.

* Version 1.7.9 (released 2007-05-12)

** X.509 certificates are preferred over OpenPGP keys.
This is a change in the semantics of gnutls_set_default_priority.

** The included copy of OpenCDK has been updated to 0.6.1.
There has been some API changes in OpenCDK, and the GnuTLS layer have
been modified as well.  Note that while there are API/ABI incompatible
changes in OpenCDK, this does not influence GnuTLS's API/ABI because
its API/ABI have not changed.  From this version on, GnuTLS requires
OpenCDK 0.6.0 or later.

** Fix build failure caused by missing doc/gnutls-logo.pdf.

** Change certtool's default serial number from 0 to a time-based value.

** Fix X.509 signing with RSA-PKCS#1 to set a NULL parameters fields.
Before, we remove the parameters field, which resulted in a slightly
different DER encoding which in turn caused signature verification
failures of GnuTLS-generated RSA certificates in some other
implementations (e.g., GnuPG 2.x's gpgsm).  Depending on which RFCs
you read, this may or may not be correct, but our new behaviour appear
to be consistent with other widely used implementations.

** Fix mem leaks in gnutls_x509_crt_print.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.7.8 (released 2007-04-16)

** Added examples for the authorization extension.
See doc/examples/ex-client-authz.c and doc/examples/ex-serv-authz.c.

** The examples only use gnutls_set_default_priority().
The exception is when DH_ANON is needed.

** Improve gnutls_set_default_priority() priorities.
The new approach is for it to try and negotiate all secure and
standard mechanisms available.  Currently, DH_ANON ciphersuites and
LZO compressions are not enabled by default, because they are,
respectively, insecure and non-standardized.  Note that TLS 1.2 will
not be enabled by default in non-experimental release until it has
been approved by the IETF.

** gnutls-cli and gnutls-serv now uses the library's default priorities.
This means that to get DH_ANON and LZO compression, you'll need to
specify that manually using '--kx anon' or '--comp lzo'.

** Minor fixes to the human display format of X.509 certificates.

** New APIs to extract Distinguished Name's from X.509 certificates.
Based on patch from Howard Chu <hyc@symas.com>.

** Improved library searching for opencdk.
It will now add the appropriate -R or -Wl,-rpath flags as necessary.
The deprecated opencdk.m4 is no longer used.

** New APIs to list supported algorithms in the library.
The APIs are gnutls_cipher_list, gnutls_mac_list,
gnutls_compression_list, gnutls_protocol_list,
gnutls_certificate_type_list, gnutls_kx_list, and
gnutls_cipher_suite_info.  Suggested by Howard Chu <hyc@symas.com>.

** The gnutls_x509_crt_get_key_id API now handle non-RSA/DSA keys.

** New configure option --disable-tls-authorization to disable tls-authz.

** Fix prototype for `gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials'.
The last parameter was renamed from 'flags' to 'format' and the type
changed from 'unsigned int' to 'gnutls_psk_key_flags' (an enum type),
which shouldn't cause any ABI changes.  Reported by ludo@chbouib.org
(Ludovic Courtès).

** Fix allocation in gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_key.
Tiny patch from ludo@chbouib.org (Ludovic Courtès).

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_dn_t: ADD.
gnutls_x509_ava_st: ADD.
gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject,
gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer: ADD.
gnutls_x509_dn_get_rdn_ava: ADD.
gnutls_cipher_list: ADD.
gnutls_mac_list: ADD.
gnutls_compression_list: ADD.
gnutls_protocol_list: ADD.
gnutls_certificate_type_list: ADD.
gnutls_kx_list: ADD.
gnutls_cipher_suite_info: ADD.

* Version 1.7.7 (released 2007-02-22)

** Support for supplemental handshake messages and authorization data.
Supplemental data is described in RFC 4680 and the authorization
extensions in draft-housley-tls-authz-extns-07.

** Support for authorization data in gnutls-cli and gnutls-serv.
New parameters --authz-x509-attr-cert and --authz-saml-assertion.

** Fix for gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname.
Before it would have reported that the certificate matched a hostname
when it did not have any dNSName or any CN field.  Report and tiny
patch from "Richard W.M. Jones" <rjones@redhat.com>.

** New self test for RFC 2818 comparison in gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname.
Tests regressions of the bug, and several other features.

** GnuTLS now matches URI's with IP Addresses against iPAddress SAN's.
Before there were no support for iPAddress SAN's during comparison.

** New API to print information about CRL's.
The function is gnutls_x509_crl_print.

** New API to extract signature value from CRL's.
The function is gnutls_x509_crl_get_signature.

** Support for directoryName Subject Alternative Name's.
The gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name function returns the DN as a
string in the provided buffer.

** Internal improvements to certtool.
It uses gnutls_x509_crl_print to print CRL information.  It uses some
more gnulib modules to simplify error handling.

** API and ABI modifications:
GNUTLS_HANDSHAKE_SUPPLEMENTAL: ADD, new gnutls_handshake_description_t element.
gnutls_supplemental_data_format_type_t: ADD.
gnutls_authz_data_format_type_t: ADD.
gnutls_supplemental_get_name: ADD.
gnutls_authz_recv_callback_func,
gnutls_authz_send_callback_func: ADD, callback prototypes.
gnutls_authz_enable: ADD.
gnutls_authz_send_x509_attr_cert,
gnutls_authz_send_saml_assertion,
gnutls_authz_send_x509_attr_cert_url,
gnutls_authz_send_saml_assertion_url: ADD.
GNUTLS_SAN_DN: ADD, new gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t element.
gnutls_x509_crl_print: ADD.
gnutls_x509_crl_get_signature: ADD.

* Version 1.7.6 (released 2007-02-12)

** Support for 'otherName' Subject Alternative Names.
The existing API gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name may now return
the new type GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME together with the otherName value.
To find out the otherName OID (necessary for proper parsing of the
value), use the new API gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_othername_oid.
For known OIDs, gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_othername_oid will
return "virtual" SAN values, e.g., GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_XMPP to
simplify OID matching.  Suggested by Matthias Wimmer <m@tthias.eu>.

** Certtool can print otherName SAN values for certificates.
For known otherName OIDs (currently only id-on-xmppAddr as defined by
RFC 3920), it will also print the name.

** Fix TLS 1.2 RSA signing in servers.
Before it used the old-style MD5+SHA1 signature, but the TLS
signatures should be normal PKCS#1 signatures.  FYI, we use and
require that DigestInfo parameters are present and NULL for TLS 1.2.

** Add APIs to access X.509 extensions sequentially.
The existing APIs gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_oid() and
gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_by_oid() does not permit callers to
inspect the extensions in the order defined by the certificate.

** Add API to extract signature value from X.509 certificates.
The function is gnutls_x509_crt_get_signature.

** Fix crash when generating proxy certificates in batch mode.
If you don't specify a proxy policy in batch mode, it will use
id-ppl-inheritALL.

** Add API to print information about X.509 certificates.
The function is gnutls_x509_crt_print.

** Certtool uses the new API gnutls_x509_crt_print to print certificate info.
One consequence of this is that the output syntax has changed
slightly.  Some more fields are printed.

** Doc fixes.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crt_print: ADD
gnutls_certificate_print_formats_t: ADD, new enum.
gnutls_x509_crt_get_signature: ADD.
gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_data: ADD.
gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_info: ADD.
gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_othername_oid: ADD.
GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME: ADD, new gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t element.
GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_XMPP: ADD, new gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t element.

* Version 1.7.5 (released 2007-02-06)

** Servers won't negotiate SRP RSA/DSS cipher suites if no SRP credential
** is set.

** Default behaviour for the gnutls-cli and gnutls-serv tools improved.

** Fix --list output for gnutls-cli and gnutls-serv.
Mention TLS1.2, SHA512 etc.

** Manual contains new section on setting up a test HTTP server.
A server set up following those descriptions are available online via
<http://www.gnutls.org/server.html>.

** Update of gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.7.4 (released 2007-02-05)

** Support for RSA signing using SHA-256/384/512.
A new self test "sha2" tries to build a long X.509 certificate chain
testing all new hashes.

** The gnutls-serv tool now use static DH parameters if none are supplied.

** Discuss proxy certificates in the manual.

** Improve bibliographical citations in the manual.

** Update of gnulib files.

** Fix certtool template handling of pathLenConstraints.
It now defaults to -1 instead of 0, which causes the field to be
missing unless the template specify it.

** API and ABI modifications:
GNUTLS_MAC_SHA256,
GNUTLS_MAC_SHA384,
GNUTLS_MAC_SHA512: New gnutls_mac_algorithm_t values.
GNUTLS_DIG_SHA256,
GNUTLS_DIG_SHA384,
GNUTLS_DIG_SHA512: New gnutls_digest_algorithm_t values.
GNUTLS_SIGN_RSA_SHA256,
GNUTLS_SIGN_RSA_SHA384,
GNUTLS_SIGN_RSA_SHA512: New gnutls_sign_algorithm_t values.

* Version 1.7.3 (released 2007-02-01)

** New option to certtool: --generate-proxy.
This will generate a Proxy Certificate from an end entity certificate.
Proxy Certificates are documented in RFC 3820.  You will need to
specify the proxy certificate's private key with --load-privkey, the
user certificate with --load-certificate and the private key used to
sign the new proxy certificate with --load-ca-privkey.  Certtool will
query for proxy path length and the policy language OID.  Currently
only OIDs that have an empty policy are supported (which includes the
two OIDs defined by RFC 3820).

** Certtool --certificate-info now prints information for Proxy Certificates.
Before the proxy extension was just printed as DER encoded data.

** New APIs to set proxy subject names and get/set proxy cert extension.

** Fix parsing of pathLenConstraints in BasicConstraints with missing cA.

** Added self-test to test for regressions of pathLenConstraint bug.
Incidentally, this also test (some) other regressions or changes in
the output from certtool --certificate-info.

** When certtool generates CA certificates, pressing enter on the path
** length constraint query will now remove the field.
Before it set the path length constraint to 0, which is a rather poor
default.

** Certtool now print times in UTC when printing certificate/CRL info.

** Add better fix to work around C++ compiler bug on Mac OS X.
Reported and tiny patch provided by Matthias Scheler <tron@NetBSD.org>.

** Fix import of ASCII armored OpenPGP keys.
Patch by ludovic.courtes@laas.fr (Ludovic Courtès).

** Update of gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crt_set_proxy_dn: ADD.
gnutls_x509_crt_set_proxy: ADD.
gnutls_x509_crt_get_proxy: ADD.

* Version 1.7.2 (released 2007-01-14)

** Certtool now print the value of the pathLenConstraints field for certs.

** Certtool now query for path length constraints when generating CA certs.
For batch uses, the certtool configuration name is "path_len".
Suggested by Sascha Ziemann <sascha.ziemann@secunet.com>.

** Add new API to get/set pathLenConstraint in the Basic Constraints.
The new functions gnutls_x509_crt_get_basic_constraints and
gnutls_x509_crt_set_basic_constraints provide a superset of the
functionality in the old gnutls_x509_crt_get_ca_status and
gnutls_x509_crt_set_ca_status (respectively), but the old functions
will continue to be supported.

** Add new API in OpenCDK to extract public/secret OpenPGP key to S-expr.
The functions are cdk_pubkey_to_sexp and cdk_seckey_to_sexp.  A proper
OpenCDK release with this patch will be made soon, which should bump
the OpenCDK version number.  Patch by Mario Lenz <mario.lenz@gmx.net>.

** Certtool --to-p12 can now store more than one certificate in the blob.
Before it could only store one certificate, but now it will read and
store as many certificate there are from the --load-certificate file.
Suggested by Sascha Ziemann <sascha.ziemann@secunet.com>.

** Clean up separation of gnutls and gnutls-extra for OpenPGP.
In particular, the OpenPGP function variables are no longer part of
the exported libgnutls interface, and no header files from
libgnutls-extra (GPL) are needed by libgnutls (LGPL).  The variables
were never intended for non-internal purposes, and thus this does not
imply a change in the external API/ABI.

** Print URL to gaa when missing, and fix srcdir!=builddir for GAA files.
Reported by ludovic.courtes@laas.fr (Ludovic Courtès).

** GnuTLS no longer uses -mms-bitfields --enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc.
Before these parameters were set to make GnuTLS build under mingw32,
however, they appear to no longer be necessary.

** A minor fix to the C++ library to make it build.
Reported by Pavlov Konstantin <thresh@altlinux.ru>.

** Update of gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crt_get_basic_constraints: ADD.
gnutls_x509_crt_set_basic_constraints: ADD.
cdk_pubkey_to_sexp: ADD (in opencdk).
cdk_seckey_to_sexp: ADD (in opencdk).

* Version 1.7.1 (released 2006-12-28)

** TLS 1.2 server side fix.
The Certificate Request sent did not contain the list of supported
hashes field, thus violating the protocol.  It will now contain an
empty list.  Reported by ludovic.courtes@laas.fr (Ludovic Courtès).

** TLS 1.2 DSA signature verification fix.
Reported by ludovic.courtes@laas.fr (Ludovic Courtès).

** Fix the list of trusted CAs that server's send to clients.
Before, the list contained issuer DN's instead of subject DN's of the
trusted CAs.  Reported by Max Kellermann <max@duempel.org>.

** Fix gnutls_certificate_set_x509_crl to initialize the CRL before using it.
Also added a self-test in tests/certificate_set_x509_crl.c to test the
function.  Reported by Max Kellermann <max@duempel.org>.

** Encode UID fields in DN's as DirectoryString.
Before GnuTLS encoded and parsed UID fields as IA5String.  This was
incorrect, it should have used DirectoryString.  Now it will use
DirectoryString for the UID field, but for backwards compatibility it
will also accept IA5String UID's.  Reported by Max Kellermann
<max@duempel.org>.

** Improve out-of-sourcedir builds from CVS.
Reported by ludovic.courtes@laas.fr (Ludovic Courtès).

** Bootstrap tools changed.
We now require autoconf 2.61, automake 1.10, and gettext 0.16, when
building GnuTLS from CVS.  Libtool 1.5.22 is used.

** Fixed a syntax error in lib/gnutls.asn.
Reported by Paul Millar <p.millar@physics.gla.ac.uk>.

** Added German translation of GnuTLS messages.

** Update of gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.7.0 (released 2006-11-29)

** The default protocol priority try TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 too.
The details is that the protocol priority set by
`gnutls_set_default_priority' has been changed from TLS 1.0 and SSL
3.0 to TLS 1.2, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0.

** Preliminary support for TLS 1.2.
The client has been successfully tested against
https://www.mikestoolbox.org:4433/.

** Anonself test now print a lot of debugging info, including TLS version.

** Doc fixes in OpenCDK, to avoid some gtk-doc warnings.

** Update of gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
GNUTLS_TLS1_2: New gnutls_protocol_t enum member.

*** Pulled up from stable 1.6.x branch:

** Fix ./configure failure with non-GCC compilers.
This fixes the following error message:
configure: error: conditional "HAVE_LD_OUTPUT_DEF" was never defined.
Reported by "Michael C. Vergallen" <mvergall@telenet.be>.

* Version 1.6.3 (released 2007-05-26)

** New API functions to extract DER encoded X.509 Subject/Issuer DN.
Suggested by Nate Nielsen <nielsen-list@memberwebs.com>.  Backported
from the 1.7.x branch, see
<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnutls/2007-05/msg00029.html>.

** Have PKCS8 parser return better error codes.
Reported by Nate Nielsen <nielsen-list@memberwebs.com>, see
<http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnutls-dev/2007-May/001653.html> and
<http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnutls-dev/2007-May/001654.html>.

** Fix mem leak for sessions with client authentication via certificates.
Reported by Andrew W. Nosenko <andrew.w.nosenko@gmail.com>, see
<http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnutls-dev/2007-April/001539.html>.

** Fix building of 'tlsia' self test.
Earlier some gcc are known to build tlsia linking to
$prefix/lib/libgnutls-extra.so rather than the libgnutls-extra.so in
the build directory, even though command line parameters look OK.
Changing order of some parameters fixes it.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crt_get_raw_issuer_dn: ADD.
gnutls_x509_crt_get_raw_dn: ADD.

* Version 1.6.2 (released 2007-04-18)

** Fix X.509 signing with RSA-PKCS#1 to set a NULL parameters fields.
Before, we remove the parameters field, which resulted in a slightly
different DER encoding which in turn caused signature verification
failures of GnuTLS-generated RSA certificates in some other
implementations (e.g., GnuPG 2.x's gpgsm).  Depending on which RFCs
you read, this may or may not be correct, but our new behaviour appear
to be consistent with other widely used implementations.

** Regenerate the PKIX ASN.1 syntax tree.
For some reason, after changing the ASN.1 type of ldap-UID in the last
release, the generated C file built from the ASN.1 schema was not
refreshed.  This can cause problems when reading/writing UID
components inside X.500 Distinguished Names.  Reported by devel
<dev001@pas-world.com>.

** Updated translations.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.6.1 (released 2006-12-28)

** Fix the list of trusted CAs that server's send to clients.
Before, the list contained issuer DN's instead of subject DN's of the
trusted CAs.  Reported by Max Kellermann <max@duempel.org>.

** Fix gnutls_certificate_set_x509_crl to initialize the CRL before using it.
Reported by Max Kellermann <max@duempel.org>.

** Encode UID fields in DN's as DirectoryString.
Before GnuTLS encoded and parsed UID fields as IA5String.  This was
incorrect, it should have used DirectoryString.  Now it will use
DirectoryString for the UID field, but for backwards compatibility it
will also accept IA5String UID's.  Reported by Max Kellermann
<max@duempel.org>.

** Fix ./configure failure with non-GCC compilers.
This fixes the following error message:
configure: error: conditional "HAVE_LD_OUTPUT_DEF" was never defined.
Reported by "Michael C. Vergallen" <mvergall@telenet.be>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.6.0 (released 2006-11-17)

** No changes since 1.5.5.
The major changes compared to the 1.4.x branch are:

*** A GnuTLS C++ library is part of the official distribution.
Currently there are no examples or documentation, but hopefully this
will change.  See gnutlsxx.h for the API.

*** Windows is a supported platform.
There are, however, two know bugs.  One is related to select() in
command line tools (not, nota bene, in the library), the other is a
problem with libgcrypt that causes delays.  Help is needed to resolve
those issues, so we feel we can't delay the release because of this.

*** New APIs for custom push/pull function error reporting.
The new APIs are gnutls_transport_set_errno and
gnutls_transport_set_global_errno.  See the release notes for version
1.5.4 for more information.

*** Self tests are run under valgrind, if available.  See --disable-valgrind.

* Version 1.5.5 (released 2006-11-16)

** Correctly bump shared library version after adding new APIs.
This was forgotten in the last release.

** Fix unsigned vs signed problem in ex-x509-info.c example.
Reported by Tim Kosse <tim.kosse@filezilla-project.org>.

** Fix the rsa-md5-collision self test to work for MinGW+Wine.

** Update of gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.5.4 (released 2006-11-07)

** New API functions to set errno in push/pull functions.
Under Windows, setting the errno variable in a push/pull replacement
may end up setting the wrong errno variable, and GnuTLS send/recv
functions become confused about the real errno returned from a failed
push/pull function.  Therefor, we have added two APIs to set the errno
variable used by GnuTLS.  The APIs can also help to keep things
thread-safe, by avoiding potentially global variables.  Typically,
instead of setting errno in your push/pull function, you will call one
of these functions.  It is recommended to use
gnutls_transport_set_errno, but if you don't have the session variable
easily accessible in the push/pull replacement function, you can use
gnutls_transport_set_global_errno.  Suggested by Tim Kosse
<tim.kosse@filezilla-project.org>.

void gnutls_transport_set_errno (gnutls_session_t session, int err);
void gnutls_transport_set_global_errno (int err);

** When calling `recv' or `send' Windows errors are handled properly.
The Windows recv/send functions doesn't use errno, and GnuTLS now use
WSAGetLastError to access the error condition instead.

** Several OpenPGP API fixes.
All suggested by ludovic.courtes@laas.fr (Ludovic Courtès).  The most
important fix is to change the return value of
gnutls_openpgp_privkey_get_pk_algorithm and
gnutls_openpgp_key_get_pk_algorithm from 'int' to
'gnutls_pk_algorithm_t', which is an enum type (and thus API/ABI
compatible with 'int').

** When a GnuTLS server receive a SSLv2 Client Hello for an unknown TLS
** version, try to negotiate the highest version support by the GnuTLS server,
** instead of the lowest.
Reported by <Pasi.Eronen@nokia.com>.

** Replace old constructs with use of gnulib modules.
For example, we can now assume unistd.h, sys/stat.h, sys/socket.h in
the code.  If the headers doesn't exist on the target system, gnulib
will make sure its replacement header files are used instead.

** Fix SOVERSION computation for *.def files.
This fixes build errors similar to "No rule to make target
`libgnutls-`expr', needed by `all-am'." when building for Windows.

** gnutls_check-version uses strverscmp from gnulib.

** Update of gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_transport_set_errno: ADD
gnutls_transport_set_global_errno: ADD

* Version 1.5.3 (released 2006-10-26)

** Add new self-test of RSA-MD5 signature chains.
Note that we already, since GnuTLS 1.2.9, reject RSA-MD5 signatures
when verifying X.509 chains.  The code is in tests/rsa-md5-collision/
and is based on the work by Marc Stevens et al, see
<http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/TargetCollidingCertificates/>.

** Re-factor self tests.

** The include copy of Libtasn1 is updated to version 0.3.7.

** The included copy of OpenCDK is updated to version 0.5.11.

** Fix the filename of the *.def file on Windows after library version bump.

** Separated the gnulib directory into one for LGPL modules and one for GPL.
This allows the GPL'd part of GnuTLS to take advantage of the GPL'd
gnulib modules.  Earlier we could only use the LGPL'ed module from
gnulib, because two gnulib directories in the same project didn't
work.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.5.2 (released 2006-10-03)

** Decrement the shared library version back to 13 (as in the 1.4.x branch).
Note that if you installed 1.5.0 or 1.5.1, they will have a higher
shared library version than this version, so you'll have to remove
them and possibly relink your applications.  The reason for this is
that no API/ABI changes have been made since the 1.4.x branch, and
that incrementing the shared library version was a mistake.  Reported
by Andreas Metzler <ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org>.

** Fix off-by-one error when computing length to malloc.
The code is used by gnutls_openpgp_add_keyring_file and
gnutls_openpgp_add_keyring_mem.  Reported by "Adam Langley"
<agl@imperialviolet.org>.

** Add version script for the GnuTLS C++ library.
Reported by Andreas Metzler <ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org>.

** Fix the C++ compiler detection logic.
Reported by Andreas Metzler <ametzler@downhill.at.eu.org>.

** Update of gnulib files.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.5.1 (released 2006-09-21)

** Fix PKCS#1 verification to avoid a variant of Bleichenbacher's
** Crypto 06 rump session attack.
In particular, we check that the digestAlgorithm.parameters field is
missing or empty, to avoid that it can contain "garbage" that may be
used to alter the numeric properties of the signature.  See
<http://www.imc.org/ietf-openpgp/mail-archive/msg14307.html> (which is
not exactly the same as the problem we fix here).  Reported by Yutaka
OIWA <y.oiwa@aist.go.jp>.

See GNUTLS-SA-2006-4 on http://www.gnutls.org/security.html for more
up to date information.

** Add self test to test for above flaw.

** Fix gnutls-cli-debug regarding resume support detection.
Earlier, if the session-id from the server had a length of 0, it would
indicate that the server supports resumption, which isn't the case.
Reported by Kataja Kai <kai.kataja@op.fi>.

** Fix building of examples on FreeBSD by including netinet/in.h.
Reported by Roman Bogorodskiy <novel@FreeBSD.org>.

** Fix certtool bug that caused the private key to not be loaded when
generating a certificate with --load-request, which in turn triggered
another unrelated bug in gnutls_x509_crt_sign2 (also fixed).  Reported
by Sascha Ziemann <sascha.ziemann@secunet.com>.

** gnutls-cli and gnutls-serv works on Windows.
The problem was the select() call that doesn't work on file
descriptors (stdin) on Windows.  We borrowed some code from plibc to
solve this.  It appears to be somewhat unreliable though.

** Autoconf 2.60 is now used.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.5.0 (released 2006-08-13)

** Change SRP and Cert-Type extensions to match IANA registry.

** Fixed bug in OpenPGP authentication handshake.

** Improvements for building under MinGW.
Provides internal inet_ntop and inet_pton functions and arpa/inet.h
header.  Calls WSAStartup and WSACleanup in gnutls_global_init and
gnutls_global_deinit, respectively.  Loads getaddrinfo and getnameinfo
at run-time from ws2_32.dll, and falls back on a simple replacement if
it is not available.  Builds the library with -mms-bitfields
-Wl,--enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc.  Links with --output-def, to
create *.def files, which are installed.

** The examples now (conditionally) include config.h and link to gnulib.
No other source changes were necessary, so the examples should
continue to be possible to use stand-alone without any autoconf or
gnulib stuff.

** Added C++ header "gnutlsxx.h" and library "libgnutlsxx".
You may unconditionally disable it with --disable-cxx.  See
includes/gnutls/gnutlsxx.h and lib/gnutlsxx.cpp for the
implementation.

** Made command line tool '--version' behave according to GNU Standards.
This enables 'make distcheck' to succeed.

** OpenCDK updated to 0.5.9 to fix some problems with OpenPGP support.

** Make --without-included-libtasn1 work.
Reported by Daniel Black <dragonheart@gentoo.org>.

** Fix a crash (strcmp() on a NULL value) in the certificate verification logic.
See https://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html regardging
GNUTLS-SA-2006-2 for more up to date information.  Reported by
satyakumar <satyam_kkd@hyd.hellosoft.com>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.4.5 (released 2006-11-06)

** When a GnuTLS server receive a SSLv2 Client Hello for an unknown TLS
** version, try to negotiate the highest version support by the GnuTLS server,
** instead of the lowest.
Reported by <Pasi.Eronen@nokia.com>.

** Fix typo in doc/examples/ex-serv-pgp.c.
Reported by Adam Langley" <agl@imperialviolet.org>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.4.4 (released 2006-09-12)

** Relax the test that caught signatures that exploit the variant of
** Bleichenbacher's Crypto 06 rump session attack on our
** verification logic flaw.
In particular, we now permit the digestAlgorithm.parameters field to
be present but empty, whereas in 1.4.3 we actually checked that the
field was absent.

** Revert the removal of debug information for the GNUTLS-SA-2006-3 problem.
The messages are only printed in debug mode, which is not recommended
for normal use, and thus logging this situation cannot be abused as an
oracle in typical recommended situations.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.4.3 (released 2006-09-08)

** Fix PKCS#1 verification to avoid a variant of Bleichenbacher's
** Crypto 06 rump session attack.
In particular, we check that the digestAlgorithm.parameters field is
empty, to avoid that it can contain "garbage" that may be used to
alter the numeric properties of the signature.  See

** Fix crash in gnutls_x509_crt_sign2 if passed a NULL issuer_key.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.4.2 (released 2006-08-12)

** Fix a crash (strcmp() on a NULL value) in the certificate verification logic.
This can happen if you call gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2 and have
a certain mix of local CA certificates and the peer send special
certificates, that together trigger certain behaviour.  It is not
known at this point whether the crash can be triggered without the
special local CA certificate, and thus turn this into a remote crash
of clients that verify server certificates when they talk to a server
with the special server certificate.  See GNUTLS-SA-2006-2 on
https://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html for more up to date
information.  Reported by satyakumar <satyam_kkd@hyd.hellosoft.com>.

** Change SRP and Cert-Type extensions to match IANA registry.

** OpenCDK updated to 0.5.9 to fix some problems with OpenPGP support.

** Make --without-included-libtasn1 work.
Reported by Daniel Black <dragonheart@gentoo.org>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.4.1 (released 2006-06-14)

** Replaced inactive ifdefs to enable openpgp support in test programs.

** Fixed bug in OpenPGP authentication handshake.

** Fixed typographical in man pages.

** Build fixes of the manual.

** Added Swedish translation.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.4.0 (released 2006-05-15)

** Remove GnuTLS 0.8.x compatibility functions.

** The libgcrypt RNG is initialized in gnutls_global_init().

** TLS/IA API changes from Emile van Bergen.
A dummy credential structure is not needed now, if you wish to use the
low-level TLS/IA API, simply call gnutls_ia_enable to enable TLS/IA on
a session.

** The self-tests are now run under valgrind, if it is installed.

** Libtasn1 is updated to 0.3.4, and that version is now required.

** The command line tools now use getaddrinfo and support IPv6.

** API and ABI modifications:
_gnutls_x509_get_raw_crt_activation_time,
_gnutls_x509_get_raw_crt_expiration_time: Removed.
gnutls_ia_require_inner_phase: Removed, replaced by gnutls_ia_enable.
gnutls_ia_enable: Added.

* Version 1.3.5 (released 2006-03-08)

** Error messages are now translated using GNU Gettext.

** The function gnutls_x509_crt_to_xml now return an internal error.
This means that the code to convert X.509 certificates to XML format
does not work any more.  The reason is that the function called
libtasn1 internal functions.  It seems unclean for libtasn1 to export
the APIs needed here.  Instead it would be better to implement XML
support inside libtasn1 properly.  If you need this functionality
strongly, please consider looking into implementing this suggested
approach instead.  As a workaround, you may also modify lib/x509/xml.c
(change '#if 1' to '#if 0') and build using --with-included-libtasn1.

** Libraries are now built with libtool's -no-undefined.
This helps producing libraries for Windows using mingw32.

** Doc fixes to explain that gnutls_record_send can block.

** Libtasn1 0.3.1 or later is now required.
The include copy has been updated too.

** gnutls-cli can now recognize services and port numbers with the -p option.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.3.4 (released 2006-02-09)

** Fix read of out bounds bug in DER parser.
Reported by Evgeny Legerov <admin@gleg.net>, and debugging help from
Protover SSL.  Libtasn1 0.2.18 is now required, which contains the
previous bug fix.  The included libtasn1 version in GnuTLS has been
updated.

** Fixed bug in non-blocking gnutls_bye(). gnutls_record_send() will no
longer invalidate a session if the underlying send fails, but it will
prevent future writes. That is to allow reading the already received data.
Patches and bug reports by Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>

** Corrected bugs in gnutls_certificate_set_x509_crl() and
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust(), that caused memory corruption if
more than one certificates were added. Report and patch by Max Kellermann.

** Fix build problems of OpenCDK on AIX.
Thanks to "Heiden, John" <JHeiden@UTNet.UToledo.Edu>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 1.3.3 (released 2006-01-12)

** New API to access the TLS master secret.
When possible, you should use the TLS PRF functions instead.
Suggested by Jouni Malinen <jkmaline@cc.hut.fi>.

** Improved handling when multiple libraries use GnuTLS at the same time.
Now gnutls_global_init() can be called multiple times, and
gnutls_global_deinit() will only deallocate the structure when it has
been called as many times as gnutls_global_init() was called.

** Added a self test of TLS resume functionality.

** Fix crash in TLS resume code, caused by TLS/IA changes.

** Documentation fixes about thread unsafety, prompted by
** discussion with bryanh@giraffe-data.com (Bryan Henderson).
In particular, gnutls_global_init() and gnutls_global_deinit() are not
thread safe.  Careful callers may want to protect the call using a
mutex.  The problem could also be ignored, which would cause a memory
leak under rare conditions when two threads invoke the function
roughly at the same time.

** Add 'const' keywords in various places, from Frediano ZIGLIO.

** The code was indented again, including the external header files.

** API and ABI modifications:
New functions to retrieve the master secret value:
  gnutls_session_get_master_secret

Add a 'const' keyword to existing API:
  gnutls_x509_crq_get_challenge_password

* Version 1.3.2 (released 2005-12-15)

** GnuTLS now support TLS Inner application (TLS/IA).
This is per draft-funk-tls-inner-application-extension-01.  This
functionality is added to libgnutls-extra, so it is licensed under the
GNU General Public License.

** New APIs to access the TLS Pseudo-Random-Function (PRF).
The PRF is used by some protocols building on TLS, such as EAP-PEAP
and EAP-TTLS.  One function to access the raw PRF and one to access
the PRF seeded with the client/server random fields are provided.
Suggested by Jouni Malinen <jkmaline@cc.hut.fi>.

** New APIs to acceess the client and server random fields in a session.
These fields can be useful by protocols using TLS.  Note that these
fields are typically used as input to the TLS PRF, and if this is your
intended use, you should use the TLS PRF API that use the
client/server random field directly.  Suggested by Jouni Malinen
<jkmaline@cc.hut.fi>.

** Internal type cleanups.
The uint8, uint16, uint32 types have been replaced by uint8_t,
uint16_t, uint32_t.  Gnulib is used to guarantee the presence of
correct types on platforms that lack them.  The uint type have been
replaced by unsigned.

** API and ABI modifications:
New functions to invoke the TLS Pseudo-Random-Function (PRF):
  gnutls_prf
  gnutls_prf_raw

New functions to retrieve the session's client and server random values:
  gnutls_session_get_server_random
  gnutls_session_get_client_random

New function, to perform TLS/IA handshake:
  gnutls_ia_handshake

New function to decide whether to do a TLS/IA handshake:
  gnutls_ia_handshake_p

New functions to allocate a TLS/IA credential:
  gnutls_ia_allocate_client_credentials
  gnutls_ia_free_client_credentials
  gnutls_ia_allocate_server_credentials
  gnutls_ia_free_server_credentials

New functions to handle the AVP callback:
  gnutls_ia_set_client_avp_function
  gnutls_ia_set_client_avp_ptr
  gnutls_ia_get_client_avp_ptr
  gnutls_ia_set_server_avp_function
  gnutls_ia_set_server_avp_ptr
  gnutls_ia_get_server_avp_ptr

New functions, to toggle TLS/IA application phases:
  gnutls_ia_require_inner_phase

New function to mix session keys with inner secret:
  gnutls_ia_permute_inner_secret

Low-level API (used internally by gnutls_ia_handshake):
  gnutls_ia_endphase_send
  gnutls_ia_send
  gnutls_ia_recv

New functions that can be used after successful TLS/IA negotiation:
  gnutls_ia_generate_challenge
  gnutls_ia_extract_inner_secret

Enum type with TLS/IA modes:
  gnutls_ia_mode_t

Enum type with TLS/IA packet types:
  gnutls_ia_apptype_t

Enum values for TLS/IA alerts:
  GNUTLS_A_INNER_APPLICATION_FAILURE
  GNUTLS_A_INNER_APPLICATION_VERIFICATION

New error codes, to signal when an application phase has finished:
  GNUTLS_E_WARNING_IA_IPHF_RECEIVED
  GNUTLS_E_WARNING_IA_FPHF_RECEIVED

New error code to signal TLS/IA verify failure:
  GNUTLS_E_IA_VERIFY_FAILED

* Version 1.3.1 (released 2005-12-08)

** Support for DHE-PSK cipher suites has been added.
This method offers perfect forward secrecy.

** Fix gnutls-cli STARTTLS hang when SIGINT is sent too quickly, thanks to
Otto Maddox <ottomaddox@fastmail.fm> and Nozomu Ando <nand@mac.com>.

** Corrected a bug in certtool for 64 bit machines. Reported
by Max Kellermann <max@duempel.org>.

** New function to set a X.509 private key and certificate pairs, and/or
CRLs, from an PKCS#12 file, suggested by Emile van Bergen
<emile@e-advies.nl>.

The integrity of the PKCS#12 file is protected through a password
based MAC; public-key based signatures for integrity protection are
not supported.  PKCS#12 bags may be encrypted using password derived
symmetric keys, public-key based encryption is not supported.  The
PKCS#8 keys may be encrypted using passwords.  The API use the same
password for all operations.  We believe that any more flexibility
create too much complexity that would hurt overall security, but may
add more PKCS#12 related APIs if real-world experience indicate
otherwise.

** gnutls_x509_privkey_import_pkcs8 now accept unencrypted PEM PKCS#8 keys,
reported by Emile van Bergen <emile@e-advies.nl>.
This will enable "certtool -k -8" to parse those keys.

** Certtool now generate keys in unencrypted PKCS#8 format for empty passwords.
Use "certtool -p -8" and press press enter at the prompt.  Earlier,
certtool would have encrypted the key using an empty password.

** Certtool now accept --password for --key-info and encrypted PKCS#8 keys.
Earlier it would have prompted the user for it, even if --password was
supplied.

** Added self test of PKCS#8 parsing.
Unencrypted and encrypted (pbeWithSHAAnd3-KeyTripleDES-CBC and
pbeWithSHAAnd40BitRC2-CBC) formats are tested.  The test is in
tests/pkcs8.

** API and ABI modifications:
New function to set X.509 credentials from a PKCS#12 file:
  gnutls_certificate_set_x509_simple_pkcs12_file

New gnutls_kx_algorithm_t enum type:
  GNUTLS_KX_DHE_PSK

New API to return session data (basically same as gnutls_session_get_data):
  gnutls_session_get_data2

New API to set PSK Diffie-Hellman parameters:
  gnutls_psk_set_server_dh_params

* Version 1.3.0 (2005-11-15)

** Support for TLS Pre-Shared Key (TLS-PSK) ciphersuites have been added.
This add several new APIs, see below.  Read the updated manual for
more information.  A new self test "pskself" has been added, that will
test this functionality.

** The session resumption data are now system independent.

** The code has been re-indented to conform to the GNU coding style.

** Removed the RIPEMD ciphersuites.

** Added a discussion of the internals of gnutls in manual.

** Fixes for Tru64 UNIX 4.0D that lack MAP_FAILED, from Albert Chin.

** Remove trailing comma in enums, for IBM C v6, from Albert Chin.

** Make sure config.h is included first in a few files, from Albert Chin.

** Don't use C++ comments ("//") as they are invalid, from Albert Chin.

** Don't install SRP programs and man pages if --disable-srp-authentication,
from Albert Chin.

** API and ABI modifications:
New gnutls_kx_algorithm_t key exchange type: GNUTLS_KX_PSK

New gnutls_credentials_type_t credential type:
  GNUTLS_CRD_PSK

New credential types:
  gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t
  gnutls_psk_client_credentials_t

New functions to allocate PSK credentials:
  gnutls_psk_allocate_client_credentials
  gnutls_psk_free_client_credentials
  gnutls_psk_free_server_credentials
  gnutls_psk_allocate_server_credentials

New enum type for PSK key flags:
  gnutls_psk_key_flags

New function prototypes for credential callback:
  gnutls_psk_client_credentials_function
  gnutls_psk_server_credentials_function

New function to set PSK username and key:
  gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials

New function to set PSK passwd file:
  gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_file

New function to extract PSK user in server:
  gnutls_psk_server_get_username

New functions to set PSK callback:
  gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_function
  gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials_function

Use size_t instead of int for output size parameter:
  gnutls_srp_base64_encode
  gnutls_srp_base64_decode

* Version 1.2.11 (2006-05-11)
- The function gnutls_x509_crt_to_xml is not supported any more, and
  return an internal error.  The reason is that the function called
  internal libtasn1 functions which are no longer exported from
  libtasn1.
- Updated libtasn1 requirement to 0.3.4 and refreshed internal mintiasn1.
- Updated gnulib compatibility files.
- Fixed _gnutls_x509_get_raw_crt_expiration_time and
  _gnutls_x509_get_raw_crt_activation_time to return (time_t)-1 on errors.
- API and ABI modifications:
  No changes since last version.

* Version 1.2.10 (2006-02-09)
- Fix read out bounds bug in DER parser.  Reported by Evgeny Legerov
  <admin@gleg.net>, and debugging help from Protover SSL.
- Libtasn1 0.2.18 is now required (contains the previous bug fix).
  The included version has been updated too.
- Fix gnutls-cli STARTTLS hang when SIGINT is sent too quickly, thanks to
  Otto Maddox <ottomaddox@fastmail.fm> and Nozomu Ando <nand@mac.com>.
- Corrected a bug in certtool for 64 bit machines. Reported
  by Max Kellermann <max@duempel.org>.
- Corrected bugs in gnutls_certificate_set_x509_crl() and
  gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust(), that caused memory corruption if
  more than one certificates were added. Report and patch by Max Kellermann.
- Fixed bug in non-blocking gnutls_bye(). gnutls_record_send() will no
  longer invalidate a session if the underlying send fails, but it will
  prevent future writes. That is to allow reading the already received data.
  Patches and bug reports by Yoann Vandoorselaere <yoann@prelude-ids.org>

* Version 1.2.9 (2005-11-07)
- Documentation was updated and improved.
- RSA-MD2 is now supported for verifying digital signatures.
- Due to cryptographic advances, verifying untrusted X.509
  certificates signed with RSA-MD2 or RSA-MD5 will now fail with a
  GNUTLS_CERT_INSECURE_ALGORITHM verification output.  For
  applications that must remain interoperable, you can use the
  GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD2 or GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD5
  flags when verifying certificates.  Naturally, this is not
  recommended default behaviour for applications.  To enable the
  broken algorithms, call gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags with the
  proper flag, to change the verification mode used by
  gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2.
- Make it possible to send empty data through gnutls_record_send,
  to align with the send(2) API.
- Some changes in the certificate receiving part of handshake to prevent
  some possible errors with non-blocking servers.
- Added numeric version symbols to permit simple CPP-based feature
  tests, suggested by Daniel Stenberg <daniel@haxx.se>.
- The (experimental) low-level crypto alternative to libgcrypt used
  earlier (Nettle) has been replaced with crypto code from gnulib.
  This leads to easier re-use of these components in other projects,
  leading to more review and simpler maintenance.  The new configure
  parameter --with-builtin-crypto replace the old --with-nettle, and
  must be used if you wish to enable this functionality.  See README
  under "Experimental" for more information.  Internally, GnuTLS has
  been updated to use the new "Generic Crypto" API in gl/gc.h.  The
  API is similar to the old crypto/gc.h, because the gnulib code were
  based on GnuTLS's gc.h.
- Fix compiler warning in the "anonself" self test.
- API and ABI modifications:
gnutls_x509_crt_list_verify: Added 'const' to prototype in <gnutls/x509.h>.
                             This doesn't reflect a change in behaviour,
                             so we don't break backwards compatibility.
GNUTLS_MAC_MD2: New gnutls_mac_algorithm_t value.
GNUTLS_DIG_MD2: New gnutls_digest_algorithm_t value.
GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD2,
GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD5: New gnutls_certificate_verify_flags values.
                                  Use when calling
                                  gnutls_x509_crt_list_verify,
                                  gnutls_x509_crt_verify, or
                                  gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags.
GNUTLS_CERT_INSECURE_ALGORITHM: New gnutls_certificate_status_t value,
                                used when broken signature algorithms
                                is used (currently RSA-MD2/MD5).
LIBGNUTLS_VERSION_MAJOR,
LIBGNUTLS_VERSION_MINOR,
LIBGNUTLS_VERSION_PATCH,
LIBGNUTLS_VERSION_NUMBER: New CPP symbols, indicating the GnuTLS
			  version number, can be used for feature existence
			  tests.

- Libgcrypt 1.2.2 is required to fix a bug for forking GnuTLS servers.
- Don't install the auxilliary libexamples library used by the
  examples in doc/examples/ on "make install", report and tiny patch
  from Thomas Klausner <tk@giga.or.at>.
- If you pass a X.509 CA or PGP trust database to the command line
  tool, it will now abort the connection if the server certificate
  validation fails.  Use the parameter --insecure to continue even
  after certificate validation failures.  Inspired from discussion
  with Alexander Kotelnikov <sacha@myxomop.com>.
- The test for socklen_t has been moved to gnulib.
- Link failures for duplicate or missing "program_name" symbol has been fixed,
  patch from Martin Lambers <marlam@marlam.de>.

- API and ABI modifications:
  No changes since last version.  At least not intentional, but due
  to the include header changes, there may be inadvertant changes,
  please let us know if you find any.

* Version 1.2.1 (2005-04-04)
- gnutls_bye() will no longer fail when RDWR is used and application
  data are available for reading.
- Added more strict checks for the SRP parameters (g,n), when they
  are not in the included list.
- Added warning to certtool when MD5 is being used for digital
  signatures.
- Optimizations ("-O2 -finline-functions") are not enabled by default,
  instead the standard autoconf defaults are used.  Use `./configure
  CFLAGS="-O2 -finline-functions"' to get the old optimizations.
- Added the option --get-dh-params to certtool, in order to get the
  parameters included in the library primes and generators.
- Improved the semantics of GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT, to
  allow only trusted Version 1 CAs and introduced
  GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_ANY_X509_V1_CA_CRT which has the old semantics.
- Nettle self tests now build properly, reported by Pierre
  <pierre42d@9online.fr>.
- Eliminated some memory leaks in DHE and RSA-EXPORT cipher suites.

- The API manual is included in Devhelp format.  (Was in last release too,
  but the NEWS entry was forgotten.)
- The OpenSSL compatibility code now use the internal crypto interface.
- Added simple self test of OpenSSL compatibility library.
- Internally, libtool convenience libraries are used.
- Cleanups to configure.ac.

* Version 1.1.21 (2004-10-27)
- Print DN of certificates with unknown characters in them, but in hexform
  only.

- Added gnutls_certificate_verify_peers to gnutls/compat.h.
  Nikos deprecated gnutls_certificate_verify_peers in favor of
  gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2 earlier in the 1.1 branch.
- Improvements to the manual.
- Add new example "ex-rfc2818" for certificate verification, from Nikos.
- Known bug: the library require snprintf.  This has not yet been

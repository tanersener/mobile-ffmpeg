@node Simple client example with X.509 certificate support
@subsection Simple client example with @acronym{X.509} certificate support
@anchor{ex-verify}

Let's assume now that we want to create a TCP client which
communicates with servers that use @acronym{X.509} certificate authentication.
The following client is a very simple @acronym{TLS} client, which uses
the high level verification functions for certificates, but does not support session
resumption.

Note that this client utilizes functionality present in the latest GnuTLS
version. For a reasonably portable version see @ref{Legacy client example with X.509 certificate support}.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-client-x509.c

@node Simple client example with SSH-style certificate verification
@subsection Simple client example with SSH-style certificate verification

This is an alternative verification function that will use the
X.509 certificate authorities for verification, but also assume an
trust on first use (SSH-like) authentication system. That is the user is 
prompted on unknown public keys and known public keys are considered 
trusted.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-verify-ssh.c

@node Simple client example with anonymous authentication
@subsection Simple client example with anonymous authentication

The simplest client using TLS is the one that doesn't do any
authentication.  This means no external certificates or passwords are
needed to set up the connection.  As could be expected, the connection
is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (active or redirection) attacks.
However, the data are integrity protected and encrypted from
passive eavesdroppers.

Note that due to the vulnerable nature of this method very few public
servers support it.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-client-anon.c


@node Simple Datagram TLS client example
@subsection Simple datagram @acronym{TLS} client example

This is a client that uses @acronym{UDP} to connect to a
server. This is the @acronym{DTLS} equivalent to the TLS example
with X.509 certificates.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-client-dtls.c

@node Obtaining session information
@subsection Obtaining session information

Most of the times it is desirable to know the security properties of
the current established session.  This includes the underlying ciphers
and the protocols involved.  That is the purpose of the following
function.  Note that this function will print meaningful values only
if called after a successful @funcref{gnutls_handshake}.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-session-info.c

@node Using a callback to select the certificate to use
@subsection Using a callback to select the certificate to use

There are cases where a client holds several certificate and key
pairs, and may not want to load all of them in the credentials
structure.  The following example demonstrates the use of the
certificate selection callback.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-cert-select.c

@node Verifying a certificate
@subsection Verifying a certificate
@anchor{ex-verify2}

An example is listed below which uses the high level verification
functions to verify a given certificate list.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-verify.c

@node Client using a smart card with TLS
@subsection Using a smart card with TLS
@anchor{ex-pkcs11-client}
@cindex Smart card example

This example will demonstrate how to load keys and certificates
from a smart-card or any other @acronym{PKCS} #11 token, and 
use it in a TLS connection.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-cert-select-pkcs11.c


@node Client with Resume capability example
@subsection Client with resume capability example
@anchor{ex-resume-client}

This is a modification of the simple client example. Here we
demonstrate the use of session resumption. The client tries to connect
once using @acronym{TLS}, close the connection and then try to
establish a new connection using the previously negotiated data.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-client-resume.c


@node Simple client example with SRP authentication
@subsection Simple client example with @acronym{SRP} authentication

The following client is a very simple @acronym{SRP} @acronym{TLS}
client which connects to a server and authenticates using a
@emph{username} and a @emph{password}. The server may authenticate
itself using a certificate, and in that case it has to be verified.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-client-srp.c


@node Legacy client example with X.509 certificate support
@subsection Legacy client example with @acronym{X.509} certificate support
@anchor{ex-verify-legacy}

For applications that need to maintain compatibility with the GnuTLS 3.1.x
library, this client example is identical to @ref{Simple client example with X.509 certificate support}
but utilizes APIs that were available in GnuTLS 3.1.4. 

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-client-x509-3.1.c


@node Simple client example in C++
@subsection Simple client example using the C++ API

The following client is a simple example of a client client utilizing
the GnuTLS C++ API.

@verbatiminclude examples/ex-cxx.cpp

@node Helper functions for TCP connections
@subsection Helper functions for TCP connections

Those helper function abstract away TCP connection handling from the
other examples.  It is required to build some examples.

@verbatiminclude examples/tcp.c

@node Helper functions for UDP connections
@subsection Helper functions for UDP connections

The UDP helper functions abstract away UDP connection handling from the
other examples.  It is required to build the examples using UDP.

@verbatiminclude examples/udp.c

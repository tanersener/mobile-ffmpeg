@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crq_sign2} (gnutls_x509_crq_t @var{crq}, gnutls_x509_privkey_t @var{key}, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t @var{dig}, unsigned int @var{flags})
@var{crq}: should contain a @code{gnutls_x509_crq_t}  type

@var{key}: holds a private key

@var{dig}: The message digest to use, i.e., @code{GNUTLS_DIG_SHA1} 

@var{flags}: must be 0

This function will sign the certificate request with a private key.
This must be the same key as the one used in
@code{gnutls_x509_crt_set_key()}  since a certificate request is self
signed.

This must be the last step in a certificate request generation
since all the previously set parameters are now signed.

@strong{Returns:} @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  on success, otherwise a negative error code.
@code{GNUTLS_E_ASN1_VALUE_NOT_FOUND}  is returned if you didn't set all
information in the certificate request (e.g., the version using
@code{gnutls_x509_crq_set_version()} ).

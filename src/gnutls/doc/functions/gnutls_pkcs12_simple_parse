@var{p12}: A pkcs12 type

@var{password}: optional password used to decrypt the structure, bags and keys.

@var{key}: a structure to store the parsed private key.

@var{chain}: the corresponding to key certificate chain (may be @code{NULL} )

@var{chain_len}: will be updated with the number of additional (may be @code{NULL} )

@var{extra_certs}: optional pointer to receive an array of additional
certificates found in the PKCS12 structure (may be @code{NULL} ).

@var{extra_certs_len}: will be updated with the number of additional
certs (may be @code{NULL} ).

@var{crl}: an optional structure to store the parsed CRL (may be @code{NULL} ).

@var{flags}: should be zero or one of GNUTLS_PKCS12_SP_*

This function parses a PKCS12 structure in  @code{pkcs12} and extracts the
private key, the corresponding certificate chain, any additional
certificates and a CRL.

The  @code{extra_certs} and  @code{extra_certs_len} parameters are optional
and both may be set to @code{NULL} . If either is non-@code{NULL} , then both must
be set. The value for  @code{extra_certs} is allocated
using @code{gnutls_malloc()} .

Encrypted PKCS12 bags and PKCS8 private keys are supported, but
only with password based security and the same password for all
operations.

Note that a PKCS12 structure may contain many keys and/or certificates,
and there is no way to identify which key/certificate pair you want.
For this reason this function is useful for PKCS12 files that contain 
only one key/certificate pair and/or one CRL.

If the provided structure has encrypted fields but no password
is provided then this function returns @code{GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED} .

Note that normally the chain constructed does not include self signed
certificates, to comply with TLS' requirements. If, however, the flag 
@code{GNUTLS_PKCS12_SP_INCLUDE_SELF_SIGNED}  is specified then
self signed certificates will be included in the chain.

Prior to using this function the PKCS @code{12}  structure integrity must
be verified using @code{gnutls_pkcs12_verify_mac()} .

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.

@strong{Since:} 3.1.0

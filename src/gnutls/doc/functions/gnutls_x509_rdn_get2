@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_rdn_get2} (const gnutls_datum_t * @var{idn}, gnutls_datum_t * @var{str}, unsigned @var{flags})
@var{idn}: should contain a DER encoded RDN sequence

@var{str}: -- undescribed --

@var{flags}: -- undescribed --

This function will return the name of the given RDN sequence.  The
name will be in the form "C=xxxx,O=yyyy,CN=zzzz" as described in
RFC4514.

When the flag @code{GNUTLS_X509_DN_FLAG_COMPAT}  is specified, the output
format will match the format output by previous to 3.5.6 versions of GnuTLS
which was not not fully RFC4514-compliant.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, or
@code{GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER}  is returned and * @code{buf_size} is
updated if the provided buffer is not long enough, otherwise a
negative error value.

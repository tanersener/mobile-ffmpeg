@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_file2} (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t @var{sc}, const char * @var{response_file}, unsigned @var{idx}, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t @var{fmt})
@var{sc}: is a credentials structure.

@var{response_file}: a filename of the OCSP response

@var{idx}: is a certificate index as returned by @code{gnutls_certificate_set_key()}  and friends

@var{fmt}: is PEM or DER

This function loads the OCSP responses to be sent to the
peer for the certificate chain specified by  @code{idx} . When  @code{fmt} is
set to PEM, multiple responses can be loaded.

This function must be called after setting any certificates, and
cannot be used for certificates that are provided via a callback --
that is when @code{gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function()}  is used. In
that case consider using @code{gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function3()} .

This function can be called multiple times when multiple responses
applicable to the certificate chain are available.
If the response provided does not match any certificates present
in the chain, the code @code{GNUTLS_E_OCSP_MISMATCH_WITH_CERTS}  is returned.
If the response is already expired at the time of loading the code
@code{GNUTLS_E_EXPIRED}  is returned.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned,
otherwise a negative error code is returned.

@strong{Since:} 3.1.3

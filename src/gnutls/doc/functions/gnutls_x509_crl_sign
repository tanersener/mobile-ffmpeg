@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crl_sign} (gnutls_x509_crl_t @var{crl}, gnutls_x509_crt_t @var{issuer}, gnutls_x509_privkey_t @var{issuer_key})
@var{crl}: should contain a gnutls_x509_crl_t type

@var{issuer}: is the certificate of the certificate issuer

@var{issuer_key}: holds the issuer's private key

This function is the same a @code{gnutls_x509_crl_sign2()}  with no flags,
and an appropriate hash algorithm. The hash algorithm used may
vary between versions of GnuTLS, and it is tied to the security
level of the issuer's public key.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.

@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_ocsp_status_request_is_checked} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, unsigned int @var{flags})
@var{session}: is a gnutls session

@var{flags}: should be zero or @code{GNUTLS_OCSP_SR_IS_AVAIL} 

When flags are zero this function returns non-zero if a valid OCSP status
response was included in the TLS handshake. That is, an OCSP status response
which is not too old or superseded. It returns zero otherwise.

When the flag @code{GNUTLS_OCSP_SR_IS_AVAIL}  is specified, the function
returns non-zero if an OCSP status response was included in the handshake
even if it was invalid. Otherwise, if no OCSP status response was included,
it returns zero. The @code{GNUTLS_OCSP_SR_IS_AVAIL}  flag was introduced in GnuTLS 3.4.0.

This is a helper function when needing to decide whether to perform an
explicit OCSP validity check on the peer's certificate. Should be called after
any of gnutls_certificate_verify_peers*() are called.

This function is always usable on client side, but on server side only
under TLS 1.3, which is the first version of TLS that allows cliend-side OCSP
responses.

@strong{Returns:} non zero if the response was valid, or a zero if it wasn't sent,
or sent and was invalid.

@strong{Since:} 3.1.4

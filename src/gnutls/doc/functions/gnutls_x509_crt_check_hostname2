@deftypefun {unsigned} {gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname2} (gnutls_x509_crt_t @var{cert}, const char * @var{hostname}, unsigned int @var{flags})
@var{cert}: should contain an gnutls_x509_crt_t type

@var{hostname}: A null terminated string that contains a DNS name

@var{flags}: gnutls_certificate_verify_flags

This function will check if the given certificate's subject matches
the given hostname.  This is a basic implementation of the matching
described in RFC6125, and takes into account wildcards,
and the DNSName/IPAddress subject alternative name PKIX extension.

IPv4 addresses are accepted by this function in the dotted-decimal
format (e.g, ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd), and IPv6 addresses in the hexadecimal
x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x format. For them the IPAddress subject alternative
name extension is consulted, as well as the DNSNames in case of a non-match.
The latter fallback exists due to misconfiguration of many servers
which place an IPAddress inside the DNSName extension.

When the flag @code{GNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_WILDCARDS}  is specified no
wildcards are considered. Otherwise they are only considered if the
domain name consists of three components or more, and the wildcard
starts at the leftmost position.

@strong{Returns:} non-zero for a successful match, and zero on failure.

@var{crt}: should contain a @code{gnutls_x509_crt_t}  type

@var{indx}: This specifies which policy to return. Use (0) to get the first one.

@var{policy}: A pointer to a policy structure.

@var{critical}: will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical

This function will extract the certificate policy (extension 2.5.29.32) 
specified by the given index. 

The policy returned by this function must be deinitialized by using
@code{gnutls_x509_policy_release()} .

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, @code{GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE} 
if the extension is not present, otherwise a negative error value.

@strong{Since:} 3.1.5

@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_crls} (gnutls_x509_trust_list_t @var{list}, const gnutls_x509_crl_t * @var{crl_list}, unsigned @var{crl_size}, unsigned int @var{flags}, unsigned int @var{verification_flags})
@var{list}: The list

@var{crl_list}: A list of CRLs

@var{crl_size}: The length of the CRL list

@var{flags}: flags from @code{gnutls_trust_list_flags_t} 

@var{verification_flags}: gnutls_certificate_verify_flags if flags specifies GNUTLS_TL_VERIFY_CRL

This function will add the given certificate revocation lists
to the trusted list. The list of CRLs must not be deinitialized
during this structure's lifetime.

This function must be called after @code{gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_cas()} 
to allow verifying the CRLs for validity. If the flag @code{GNUTLS_TL_NO_DUPLICATES} 
is given, then any provided CRLs that are a duplicate, will be deinitialized
and not added to the list (that assumes that @code{gnutls_x509_trust_list_deinit()} 
will be called with all=1).

If GNUTLS_TL_VERIFY_CRL is given the CRLs will be verified before being added.

@strong{Returns:} The number of added elements is returned.

@strong{Since:} 3.0

@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_record_can_use_length_hiding} (gnutls_session_t @var{session})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

If the session supports length-hiding padding, you can
invoke @code{gnutls_range_send_message()}  to send a message whose
length is hidden in the given range. If the session does not
support length hiding padding, you can use the standard
@code{gnutls_record_send()}  function, or @code{gnutls_range_send_message()} 
making sure that the range is the same as the length of the
message you are trying to send.

@strong{Returns:} true (1) if the current session supports length-hiding
padding, false (0) if the current session does not.

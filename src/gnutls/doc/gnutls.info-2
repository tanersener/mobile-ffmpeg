5.4 Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
=================================

In this section we present the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) support in
GnuTLS.  Note that we recommend against using TPM with this API because
it is restricted to TPM 1.2.  We recommend instead to use PKCS#11
wrappers for TPM such as CHAPS(1) or opencryptoki(2).  These will allow
using the standard smart card and HSM functionality (see *note Smart
cards and HSMs::) for TPM keys.

There was a big hype when the TPM chip was introduced into computers.
Briefly it is a co-processor in your PC that allows it to perform
calculations independently of the main processor.  This has good and bad
side-effects.  In this section we focus on the good ones; these are the
fact that you can use the TPM chip to perform cryptographic operations
on keys stored in it, without accessing them.  That is very similar to
the operation of a PKCS #11 smart card.  The chip allows for storage and
usage of RSA keys, but has quite some operational differences from PKCS
#11 module, and thus require different handling.  The basic TPM
operations supported and used by GnuTLS, are key generation and signing.
That support is currently limited to TPM 1.2.

The next sections assume that the TPM chip in the system is already
initialized and in a operational state.  If not, ensure that the TPM
chip is enabled by your BIOS, that the 'tcsd' daemon is running, and
that TPM ownership is set (by running 'tpm_takeownership').

In GnuTLS the TPM functionality is available in 'gnutls/tpm.h'.

5.4.1 Keys in TPM
-----------------

The RSA keys in the TPM module may either be stored in a flash memory
within TPM or stored in a file in disk.  In the former case the key can
provide operations as with PKCS #11 and is identified by a URL. The URL
is described in [*note TPMURI::] and is of the following form.
tpmkey:uuid=42309df8-d101-11e1-a89a-97bb33c23ad1;storage=user

It consists from a unique identifier of the key as well as the part of
the flash memory the key is stored at.  The two options for the storage
field are 'user' and 'system'.  The user keys are typically only
available to the generating user and the system keys to all users.  The
stored in TPM keys are called registered keys.

The keys that are stored in the disk are exported from the TPM but in an
encrypted form.  To access them two passwords are required.  The first
is the TPM Storage Root Key (SRK), and the other is a key-specific
password.  Also those keys are identified by a URL of the form:
tpmkey:file=/path/to/file

When objects require a PIN to be accessed the same callbacks as with
PKCS #11 objects are expected (see *note Accessing objects that require
a PIN::).  Note that the PIN function may be called multiple times to
unlock the SRK and the specific key in use.  The label in the key
function will then be set to 'SRK' when unlocking the SRK key, or to
'TPM' when unlocking any other key.

5.4.2 Key generation
--------------------

All keys used by the TPM must be generated by the TPM. This can be done
using *note gnutls_tpm_privkey_generate::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_tpm_privkey_generate (gnutls_pk_algorithm_t PK,
          unsigned int BITS, const char * SRK_PASSWORD, const char *
          KEY_PASSWORD, gnutls_tpmkey_fmt_t FORMAT,
          gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t PUB_FORMAT, gnutls_datum_t * PRIVKEY,
          gnutls_datum_t * PUBKEY, unsigned int FLAGS)
     PK: the public key algorithm

     BITS: the security bits

     SRK_PASSWORD: a password to protect the exported key (optional)

     KEY_PASSWORD: the password for the TPM (optional)

     FORMAT: the format of the private key

     PUB_FORMAT: the format of the public key

     PRIVKEY: the generated key

     PUBKEY: the corresponding public key (may be null)

     FLAGS: should be a list of GNUTLS_TPM_* flags

     This function will generate a private key in the TPM chip.  The
     private key will be generated within the chip and will be exported
     in a wrapped with TPM's master key form.  Furthermore the wrapped
     key can be protected with the provided 'password' .

     Note that bits in TPM is quantized value.  If the input value is
     not one of the allowed values, then it will be quantized to one of
     512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192 and 16384.

     Allowed flags are:

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

'INT *note gnutls_tpm_get_registered:: (gnutls_tpm_key_list_t * LIST)'
'VOID *note gnutls_tpm_key_list_deinit:: (gnutls_tpm_key_list_t LIST)'
'INT *note gnutls_tpm_key_list_get_url:: (gnutls_tpm_key_list_t LIST, unsigned int IDX, char ** URL, unsigned int FLAGS)'

 -- Function: int gnutls_tpm_privkey_delete (const char * URL, const
          char * SRK_PASSWORD)
     URL: the URL describing the key

     SRK_PASSWORD: a password for the SRK key

     This function will unregister the private key from the TPM chip.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

5.4.3 Using keys
----------------

Importing keys
..............

The TPM keys can be used directly by the abstract key types and do not
require any special structures.  Moreover functions like *note
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file2:: can access TPM URLs.

'INT *note gnutls_privkey_import_tpm_raw:: (gnutls_privkey_t PKEY, const gnutls_datum_t * FDATA, gnutls_tpmkey_fmt_t FORMAT, const char * SRK_PASSWORD, const char * KEY_PASSWORD, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_pubkey_import_tpm_raw:: (gnutls_pubkey_t PKEY, const gnutls_datum_t * FDATA, gnutls_tpmkey_fmt_t FORMAT, const char * SRK_PASSWORD, unsigned int FLAGS)'

 -- Function: int gnutls_privkey_import_tpm_url (gnutls_privkey_t PKEY,
          const char * URL, const char * SRK_PASSWORD, const char *
          KEY_PASSWORD, unsigned int FLAGS)
     PKEY: The private key

     URL: The URL of the TPM key to be imported

     SRK_PASSWORD: The password for the SRK key (optional)

     KEY_PASSWORD: A password for the key (optional)

     FLAGS: One of the GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_* flags

     This function will import the given private key to the abstract
     'gnutls_privkey_t' type.

     Note that unless 'GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_DISABLE_CALLBACKS' is specified,
     if incorrect (or NULL) passwords are given the PKCS11 callback
     functions will be used to obtain the correct passwords.  Otherwise
     if the SRK password is wrong 'GNUTLS_E_TPM_SRK_PASSWORD_ERROR' is
     returned and if the key password is wrong or not provided then
     'GNUTLS_E_TPM_KEY_PASSWORD_ERROR' is returned.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

 -- Function: int gnutls_pubkey_import_tpm_url (gnutls_pubkey_t PKEY,
          const char * URL, const char * SRK_PASSWORD, unsigned int
          FLAGS)
     PKEY: The public key

     URL: The URL of the TPM key to be imported

     SRK_PASSWORD: The password for the SRK key (optional)

     FLAGS: should be zero

     This function will import the given private key to the abstract
     'gnutls_privkey_t' type.

     Note that unless 'GNUTLS_PUBKEY_DISABLE_CALLBACKS' is specified, if
     incorrect (or NULL) passwords are given the PKCS11 callback
     functions will be used to obtain the correct passwords.  Otherwise
     if the SRK password is wrong 'GNUTLS_E_TPM_SRK_PASSWORD_ERROR' is
     returned.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

Listing and deleting keys
.........................

The registered keys (that are stored in the TPM) can be listed using one
of the following functions.  Those keys are unfortunately only
identified by their UUID and have no label or other human friendly
identifier.  Keys can be deleted from permament storage using *note
gnutls_tpm_privkey_delete::.

'INT *note gnutls_tpm_get_registered:: (gnutls_tpm_key_list_t * LIST)'
'VOID *note gnutls_tpm_key_list_deinit:: (gnutls_tpm_key_list_t LIST)'
'INT *note gnutls_tpm_key_list_get_url:: (gnutls_tpm_key_list_t LIST, unsigned int IDX, char ** URL, unsigned int FLAGS)'

 -- Function: int gnutls_tpm_privkey_delete (const char * URL, const
          char * SRK_PASSWORD)
     URL: the URL describing the key

     SRK_PASSWORD: a password for the SRK key

     This function will unregister the private key from the TPM chip.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

5.4.4 Invoking tpmtool
----------------------

Program that allows handling cryptographic data from the TPM chip.

This section was generated by *AutoGen*, using the 'agtexi-cmd' template
and the option descriptions for the 'tpmtool' program.  This software is
released under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later.

tpmtool help/usage ('--help')
-----------------------------

This is the automatically generated usage text for tpmtool.

The text printed is the same whether selected with the 'help' option
('--help') or the 'more-help' option ('--more-help').  'more-help' will
print the usage text by passing it through a pager program.  'more-help'
is disabled on platforms without a working 'fork(2)' function.  The
'PAGER' environment variable is used to select the program, defaulting
to 'more'.  Both will exit with a status code of 0.

debug option (-d)
-----------------

This is the "enable debugging" option.  This option takes a number
argument.  Specifies the debug level.

generate-rsa option
-------------------

This is the "generate an rsa private-public key pair" option.  Generates
an RSA private-public key pair in the TPM chip.  The key may be stored
in file system and protected by a PIN, or stored (registered) in the TPM
chip flash.

user option
-----------

This is the "any registered key will be a user key" option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * must appear in combination with the following options: register.
   * must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
     system.

The generated key will be stored in a user specific persistent storage.

system option
-------------

This is the "any registered key will be a system key" option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * must appear in combination with the following options: register.

option.  This option takes a string argument 'url'.  It can be used to
test the correct operation of the signature operation.  This operation
will sign and verify the signed data.

sec-param option
----------------

This is the "specify the security level [low, legacy, medium, high,
ultra]."  option.  This option takes a string argument 'Security
parameter'.  This is alternative to the bits option.  Note however that
the values allowed by the TPM chip are quantized and given values may be
rounded up.

6.1 Introduction
================

This chapter tries to explain the basic functionality of the current
GnuTLS library.  Note that there may be additional functionality not
discussed here but included in the library.  Checking the header files
in '/usr/include/gnutls/' and the manpages is recommended.

6.1.1 General idea
------------------

A brief description of how GnuTLS sessions operate is shown at *note
Figure 6.1: fig-gnutls-design.  This section will become more clear when
it is completely read.  As shown in the figure, there is a read-only
global state that is initialized once by the global initialization
function.  This global structure, among others, contains the memory
allocation functions used, structures needed for the ASN.1 parser and
depending on the system's CPU, pointers to hardware accelerated
encryption functions.  This structure is never modified by any GnuTLS
function, except for the deinitialization function which frees all
allocated memory and must be called after the program has permanently
finished using GnuTLS.

 [image src="gnutls-internals.png" ]

Figure 6.1: High level design of GnuTLS.

The credentials structures are used by the authentication methods, such
as certificate authentication.  They store certificates, privates keys,
and other information that is needed to prove the identity to the peer,
and/or verify the identity of the peer.  The information stored in the
credentials structures is initialized once and then can be shared by
many TLS sessions.

A GnuTLS session contains all the required state and information to
handle one secure connection.  The session communicates with the peers
using the provided functions of the transport layer.  Every session has
a unique session ID shared with the peer.

Since TLS sessions can be resumed, servers need a database back-end to
hold the session's parameters.  Every GnuTLS session after a successful
handshake calls the appropriate back-end function (see *note resume::)
to store the newly negotiated session.  The session database is examined
by the server just after having received the client hello(1), and if the
session ID sent by the client, matches a stored session, the stored
session will be retrieved, and the new session will be a resumed one,
and will share the same session ID with the previous one.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: Error handling,  Next: Common types,  Prev: General idea,  Up: Introduction to the library

6.1.2 Error handling
--------------------

There two types of GnuTLS functions.  The first type returns a boolean
value, true (non-zero) or false (zero) value; these functions are
defined to return an unsigned integer type.  The other type returns a
signed integer type with zero (or a positive number) indicating success
and a negative value indicating failure.  For the latter type it is
recommended to check for errors as following.
         ret = gnutls_function();
         if (ret < 0) {
             return -1;
         }
The above example checks for a failure condition rather than for
explicit success (e.g., equality to zero).  That has the advantage that
future extensions of the API can be extended to provide additional
information via positive returned values (see for example *note
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file::).

For certain operations such as TLS handshake and TLS packet receive
there is the notion of fatal and non-fatal error codes.  Fatal errors
terminate the TLS session immediately and further sends and receives
will be disallowed.  Such an example is 'GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED'.
Non-fatal errors may warn about something, i.e., a warning alert was
received, or indicate the some action has to be taken.  This is the case
with the error code 'GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE' returned by *note
gnutls_record_recv::.  This error code indicates that the server
requests a re-handshake.  The client may ignore this request, or may
reply with an alert.  You can test if an error code is a fatal one by
using the *note gnutls_error_is_fatal::.  All errors can be converted to
a descriptive string using *note gnutls_strerror::.

If any non fatal errors, that require an action, are to be returned by a
function, these error codes will be documented in the function's
reference.  For example the error codes
'GNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED' and 'GNUTLS_E_FATAL_ALERT_RECEIVED'
that may returned when receiving data, should be handled by notifying
the user of the alert (as explained in *note Handling alerts::).  See
*note Error codes::, for a description of the available error codes.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Common types,  Next: Debugging and auditing,  Prev: Error handling,  Up: Introduction to the library

6.1.3 Common types
------------------

All strings that are to provided as input to GnuTLS functions should be
in UTF-8 unless otherwise specified.  Output strings are also in UTF-8
format unless otherwise specified.  When functions take as input
passwords, they will normalize them using [*note RFC7613::] rules (since
GnuTLS 3.5.7).

When data of a fixed size are provided to GnuTLS functions then the
helper structure 'gnutls_datum_t' is often used.  Its definition is
shown below.
  typedef struct
  {
    unsigned char *data;
    unsigned int size;
  } gnutls_datum_t;

In functions where this structure is a returned type, if the function
succeeds, it is expected from the caller to use 'gnutls_free()' to
deinitialize the data element after use, unless otherwise specified.  If
the function fails, the contents of the 'gnutls_datum_t' should be
considered undefined and must not be deinitialized.

Other functions that require data for scattered read use a structure
similar to 'struct iovec' typically used by 'readv'.  It is shown below.

6.1.4 Debugging and auditing
----------------------------

In many cases things may not go as expected and further information, to
assist debugging, from GnuTLS is desired.  Those are the cases where the
*note gnutls_global_set_log_level:: and *note
gnutls_global_set_log_function:: are to be used.  Those will print
verbose information on the GnuTLS functions internal flow.

'VOID *note gnutls_global_set_log_level:: (int LEVEL)'
'VOID *note gnutls_global_set_log_function:: (gnutls_log_func LOG_FUNC)'

Alternatively the environment variable 'GNUTLS_DEBUG_LEVEL' can be set
to a logging level and GnuTLS will output debugging output to standard
error.  Other available environment variables are shown in *note Table
6.1: tab:environment.

Variable               Purpose
                       
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
'GNUTLS_DEBUG_LEVEL'   When set to a numeric value, it sets the default
                       debugging level for GnuTLS applications.
                       
'SSLKEYLOGFILE'        When set to a filename, GnuTLS will append to it
                       the session keys in the NSS Key Log format.
                       That format can be read by wireshark and will
                       allow decryption of the session for debugging.
                       
'GNUTLS_CPUID_OVERRIDE'That environment variable can be used to
                       explicitly enable/disable the use of certain CPU
                       capabilities.  Note that CPU detection cannot be
                       overridden, i.e., VIA options cannot be enabled
                       on an Intel CPU. The currently available options
                       are:
                          * 0x1: Disable all run-time detected
                            optimizations
                          * 0x2: Enable AES-NI
                          * 0x4: Enable SSSE3
                          * 0x8: Enable PCLMUL
                          * 0x10: Enable AVX
                          * 0x20: Enable SHA_NI
                          * 0x100000: Enable VIA padlock
                          * 0x200000: Enable VIA PHE
                          * 0x400000: Enable VIA PHE SHA512
                       
'GNUTLS_FORCE_FIPS_MODE'In setups where GnuTLS is compiled with support
                       for FIPS140-2 (see *note FIPS140-2 mode::) if
                       set to one it will force the FIPS mode
                       enablement.
                       

Table 6.1: Environment variables used by the library.

When debugging is not required, important issues, such as detected
attacks on the protocol still need to be logged.  This is provided by
the logging function set by *note
gnutls_global_set_audit_log_function::.  The provided function will
receive an message and the corresponding TLS session.  The session
information might be used to derive IP addresses or other information
about the peer involved.

 -- Function: void gnutls_global_set_audit_log_function
          (gnutls_audit_log_func LOG_FUNC)
     LOG_FUNC: it is the audit log function

     This is the function to set the audit logging function.  This is a
     function to report important issues, such as possible attacks in
     the protocol.  This is different from
     'gnutls_global_set_log_function()' because it will report also
     session-specific events.  The session parameter will be null if
     there is no corresponding TLS session.

     'gnutls_audit_log_func' is of the form, void
     (*gnutls_audit_log_func)( gnutls_session_t, const char*);

     *Since:* 3.0


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Thread safety,  Next: Running in a sandbox,  Prev: Debugging and auditing,  Up: Introduction to the library

6.1.5 Thread safety
-------------------

The GnuTLS library is thread safe by design, meaning that objects of the
library such as TLS sessions, can be safely divided across threads as
long as a single thread accesses a single object.  This is sufficient to
support a server which handles several sessions per thread.  Read-only
access to objects, for example the credentials holding structures, is
also thread-safe.

A 'gnutls_session_t' object could also be shared by two threads, one
sending, the other receiving.  However, care must be taken on the
following use cases:
   * The re-handshake process in TLS 1.2 or earlier must be handled only
     in a single thread and no other thread may be performing any
     operation.
   * The flag 'GNUTLS_AUTO_REAUTH' cannot be used safely in this mode of
     operation.
   * Any other operation which may send or receive data, like key update
     (c.f., *note gnutls_session_key_update::), must not be performed
     while threads are receiving or writing.
   * The termination of a session should be handled, either by a single
     thread being active, or by the sender thread using *note
     gnutls_bye:: with 'GNUTLS_SHUT_WR' and the receiving thread waiting
     for a return value of zero (or timeout on certain servers which do
     not respond).
   * The functions *note gnutls_transport_set_errno:: and *note
     gnutls_record_get_direction:: should not be relied during parallel
     operation.

For several aspects of the library (e.g., the random generator, PKCS#11
operations), the library may utilize mutex locks (e.g., pthreads on
GNU/Linux and CriticalSection on Windows) which are transparently setup
on library initialization.  Prior to version 3.3.0 these were setup by
explicitly calling *note gnutls_global_init::.(1)

Note that, on Glibc systems, unless the application is explicitly linked
with the libpthread library, no mutex locks are used and setup by
GnuTLS. It will use the Glibc mutex stubs.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) On special systems you could manually specify the locking system
using the function *note gnutls_global_set_mutex:: before calling any
other GnuTLS function.  Setting mutexes manually is not recommended.

6.1.6 Running in a sandbox
--------------------------

Given that TLS protocol handling as well as X.509 certificate parsing
are complicated processes involving several thousands lines of code, it
is often desirable (and recommended) to run the TLS session handling in
a sandbox like seccomp.  That has to be allowed by the overall software
design, but if available, it adds an additional layer of protection by
preventing parsing errors from becoming vessels for further security
issues such as code execution.

GnuTLS requires the following system calls to be available for its
proper operation.

   * nanosleep
   * time
   * gettimeofday
   * clock_gettime
   * getrusage
   * getpid
   * send
   * recv
   * sendmsg
   * read (to read from /dev/urandom)
   * getrandom (this is Linux-kernel specific)
   * poll

As well as any calls needed for memory allocation to work.  Note
however, that GnuTLS depends on libc for the system calls, and there is
no guarantee that libc will call the expected system call.  For that it
is recommended to test your program in all the targeted platforms when
filters like seccomp are in place.

An example with a seccomp filter from GnuTLS' test suite is at:
<https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/blob/master/tests/seccomp.c>.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Sessions and fork,  Next: Callback functions,  Prev: Running in a sandbox,  Up: Introduction to the library

6.1.7 Sessions and fork
-----------------------

A 'gnutls_session_t' object can be shared by two processes after a fork,
one sending, the other receiving.  In that case rehandshakes, cannot and
must not be performed.  As with threads, the termination of a session
should be handled by the sender process using *note gnutls_bye:: with
'GNUTLS_SHUT_WR' and the receiving process waiting for a return value of
zero.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Callback functions,  Prev: Sessions and fork,  Up: Introduction to the library

6.1.8 Callback functions
------------------------

There are several cases where GnuTLS may need out of band input from
your program.  This is now implemented using some callback functions,
which your program is expected to register.

An example of this type of functions are the push and pull callbacks
which are used to specify the functions that will retrieve and send data
to the transport layer.

'VOID *note gnutls_transport_set_push_function:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_push_func PUSH_FUNC)'
'VOID *note gnutls_transport_set_pull_function:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_pull_func PULL_FUNC)'

Other callback functions may require more complicated input and data to
be allocated.  Such an example is *note
gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_function::.  All callbacks should
allocate and free memory using 'gnutls_malloc' and 'gnutls_free'.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Preparation,  Next: Session initialization,  Prev: Introduction to the library,  Up: How to use GnuTLS in applications

6.2 Preparation
===============

To use GnuTLS, you have to perform some changes to your sources and your
build system.  The necessary changes are explained in the following
subsections.

* Menu:

* Headers::
* Initialization::
* Version check::
* Building the source::


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Headers,  Next: Initialization,  Up: Preparation

6.2.1 Headers
-------------

All the data types and functions of the GnuTLS library are defined in
the header file 'gnutls/gnutls.h'.  This must be included in all
programs that make use of the GnuTLS library.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Initialization,  Next: Version check,  Prev: Headers,  Up: Preparation

6.2.2 Initialization
--------------------

The GnuTLS library is initialized on load; prior to 3.3.0 was
initialized by calling *note gnutls_global_init::(1).  The
initialization typically enables CPU-specific acceleration, performs any
required precalculations needed, opens any required system devices
(e.g., /dev/urandom on Linux) and initializes subsystems that could be
used later.

The resources allocated by the initialization process will be released
on library deinitialization.

Note that on certain systems file descriptors may be kept open by GnuTLS
(e.g.  /dev/urandom) on library load.  Applications closing all unknown
file descriptors must immediately call *note gnutls_global_init::, after
that, to ensure they don't disrupt GnuTLS' operation.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The original behavior of requiring explicit initialization can
obtained by setting the GNUTLS_NO_EXPLICIT_INIT environment variable to
1, or by using the macro GNUTLS_SKIP_GLOBAL_INIT in a global section of
your program -the latter works in systems with support for weak symbols
only.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Version check,  Next: Building the source,  Prev: Initialization,  Up: Preparation

6.2.3 Version check
-------------------

It is often desirable to check that the version of 'gnutls' used is
indeed one which fits all requirements.  Even with binary compatibility
new features may have been introduced but due to problem with the
dynamic linker an old version is actually used.  So you may want to
check that the version is okay right after program start-up.  See the
function *note gnutls_check_version::.

On the other hand, it is often desirable to support more than one
versions of the library.  In that case you could utilize compile-time
feature checks using the 'GNUTLS_VERSION_NUMBER' macro.  For example, to
conditionally add code for GnuTLS 3.2.1 or later, you may use:
     #if GNUTLS_VERSION_NUMBER >= 0x030201
      ...
     #endif


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Building the source,  Prev: Version check,  Up: Preparation

6.2.4 Building the source
-------------------------

If you want to compile a source file including the 'gnutls/gnutls.h'
header file, you must make sure that the compiler can find it in the
directory hierarchy.  This is accomplished by adding the path to the
directory in which the header file is located to the compilers include
file search path (via the '-I' option).

However, the path to the include file is determined at the time the
source is configured.  To solve this problem, the library uses the
external package 'pkg-config' that knows the path to the include file
and other configuration options.  The options that need to be added to
the compiler invocation at compile time are output by the '--cflags'
option to 'pkg-config gnutls'.  The following example shows how it can
be used at the command line:

     gcc -c foo.c `pkg-config gnutls --cflags`

Adding the output of 'pkg-config gnutls --cflags' to the compilers
command line will ensure that the compiler can find the
'gnutls/gnutls.h' header file.

A similar problem occurs when linking the program with the library.
Again, the compiler has to find the library files.  For this to work,
the path to the library files has to be added to the library search path
(via the '-L' option).  For this, the option '--libs' to 'pkg-config
gnutls' can be used.  For convenience, this option also outputs all
other options that are required to link the program with the library
(for instance, the '-ltasn1' option).  The example shows how to link
'foo.o' with the library to a program 'foo'.

     gcc -o foo foo.o `pkg-config gnutls --libs`

Of course you can also combine both examples to a single command by
specifying both options to 'pkg-config':

     gcc -o foo foo.c `pkg-config gnutls --cflags --libs`

When a program uses the GNU autoconf system, then the following line or
similar can be used to detect the presence of GnuTLS.

     PKG_CHECK_MODULES([LIBGNUTLS], [gnutls >= 3.3.0])

     AC_SUBST([LIBGNUTLS_CFLAGS])
     AC_SUBST([LIBGNUTLS_LIBS])

6.3 Session initialization
==========================

In the previous sections we have discussed the global initialization
required for GnuTLS as well as the initialization required for each
authentication method's credentials (see *note Authentication::).  In
this section we elaborate on the TLS or DTLS session initiation.  Each
session is initialized using *note gnutls_init:: which among others is
used to specify the type of the connection (server or client), and the
underlying protocol type, i.e., datagram (UDP) or reliable (TCP).

 -- Function: int gnutls_init (gnutls_session_t * SESSION, unsigned int
          FLAGS)
     SESSION: is a pointer to a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     FLAGS: indicate if this session is to be used for server or client.

     This function initializes the provided session.  Every session must
     be initialized before use, and must be deinitialized after used by
     calling 'gnutls_deinit()' .

     'flags' can be any combination of flags from 'gnutls_init_flags_t'
     .

     Note that since version 3.1.2 this function enables some common TLS
     extensions such as session tickets and OCSP certificate status
     request in client side by default.  To prevent that use the
     'GNUTLS_NO_EXTENSIONS' flag.

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' on success, or an error code.

'GNUTLS_SERVER'
     Connection end is a server.
'GNUTLS_CLIENT'
     Connection end is a client.
'GNUTLS_DATAGRAM'
     Connection is datagram oriented (DTLS). Since 3.0.0.
'GNUTLS_NONBLOCK'
     Connection should not block.  Since 3.0.0.
'GNUTLS_NO_EXTENSIONS'
     Do not enable any TLS extensions by default (since 3.1.2).  As TLS
     1.2 and later require extensions this option is considered obsolete
     and should not be used.
'GNUTLS_NO_REPLAY_PROTECTION'
     Disable any replay protection in DTLS. This must only be used if
     replay protection is achieved using other means.  Since 3.2.2.
'GNUTLS_NO_SIGNAL'
     In systems where SIGPIPE is delivered on send, it will be disabled.
     That flag has effect in systems which support the MSG_NOSIGNAL
     sockets flag (since 3.4.2).
'GNUTLS_ALLOW_ID_CHANGE'
     Allow the peer to replace its certificate, or change its ID during
     a rehandshake.  This change is often used in attacks and thus
     prohibited by default.  Since 3.5.0.
'GNUTLS_ENABLE_FALSE_START'
     Enable the TLS false start on client side if the negotiated
     ciphersuites allow it.  This will enable sending data prior to the
     handshake being complete, and may introduce a risk of crypto
     failure when combined with certain key exchanged; for that GnuTLS
     may not enable that option in ciphersuites that are known to be not
     safe for false start.  Since 3.5.0.
'GNUTLS_FORCE_CLIENT_CERT'
     When in client side and only a single cert is specified, send that
     certificate irrespective of the issuers expected by the server.
     Since 3.5.0.
'GNUTLS_NO_TICKETS'
     Flag to indicate that the session should not use resumption with
     session tickets.
'GNUTLS_KEY_SHARE_TOP'
     Generate key share for the first group which is enabled.  For
     example x25519.  This option is the most performant for client
     (less CPU spent generating keys), but if the server doesn't support
     the advertized option it may result to more roundtrips needed to
     discover the server's choice.
'GNUTLS_KEY_SHARE_TOP2'
     Generate key shares for the top-2 different groups which are
     enabled.  For example (ECDH + x25519).  This is the default.
'GNUTLS_KEY_SHARE_TOP3'
     Generate key shares for the top-3 different groups which are
     enabled.  That is, as each group is associated with a key type (EC,
     finite field, x25519), generate three keys using 'GNUTLS_PK_DH' ,
     'GNUTLS_PK_EC' , 'GNUTLS_PK_ECDH_X25519' if all of them are
     enabled.
'GNUTLS_POST_HANDSHAKE_AUTH'
     Enable post handshake authentication for server and client.  When
     set and a server requests authentication after handshake
     'GNUTLS_E_REAUTH_REQUEST' will be returned by
     'gnutls_record_recv()' .  A client should then call
     'gnutls_reauth()' to re-authenticate.
'GNUTLS_NO_AUTO_REKEY'
     Disable auto-rekeying under TLS1.3.  If this option is not
     specified gnutls will force a rekey after 2^24 records have been
     sent.
'GNUTLS_SAFE_PADDING_CHECK'
     Flag to indicate that the TLS 1.3 padding check will be done in a
     safe way which doesn't leak the pad size based on GnuTLS processing
     time.  This is of use to applications which hide the length of
     transferred data via the TLS1.3 padding mechanism and are already
     taking steps to hide the data processing time.  This comes at a
     performance penalty.
'GNUTLS_ENABLE_EARLY_START'
     Under TLS1.3 allow the server to return earlier than the full
     handshake finish; similarly to false start the handshake will be
     completed once data are received by the client, while the server is
     able to transmit sooner.  This is not enabled by default as it
     could break certain existing server assumptions and use-cases.
     Since 3.6.4.
'GNUTLS_ENABLE_RAWPK'
     Allows raw public-keys to be negotiated during the handshake.
     Since 3.6.6.
'GNUTLS_AUTO_REAUTH'
     Enable transparent re-authentication in client side when the server
     requests to.  That is, reauthentication is handled within
     'gnutls_record_recv()' , and the 'GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE' or
     'GNUTLS_E_REAUTH_REQUEST' are not returned.  This must be enabled
     with 'GNUTLS_POST_HANDSHAKE_AUTH' for TLS1.3.  Enabling this flag
     requires to restore interrupted calls to 'gnutls_record_recv()'
     based on the output of 'gnutls_record_get_direction()' , since
     'gnutls_record_recv()' could be interrupted when sending when this
     flag is enabled.  Note this flag may not be used if you are using
     the same session for sending and receiving in different threads.
'GNUTLS_ENABLE_EARLY_DATA'
     Under TLS1.3 allow the server to receive early data sent as part of
     the initial ClientHello (0-RTT). This is not enabled by default as
     early data has weaker security properties than other data.  Since
     3.6.5.

Figure 6.2: The 'gnutls_init_flags_t' enumeration.

After the session initialization details on the allowed ciphersuites and
protocol versions should be set using the priority functions such as
*note gnutls_priority_set:: and *note gnutls_priority_set_direct::.  We
elaborate on them in *note Priority Strings::.  The credentials used for
the key exchange method, such as certificates or usernames and passwords
should also be associated with the session current session using *note
gnutls_credentials_set::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_credentials_set (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          gnutls_credentials_type_t TYPE, void * CRED)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     TYPE: is the type of the credentials

     CRED: the credentials to set

     Sets the needed credentials for the specified type.  E.g.
     username, password - or public and private keys etc.  The 'cred'
     parameter is a structure that depends on the specified type and on
     the current session (client or server).

     In order to minimize memory usage, and share credentials between
     several threads gnutls keeps a pointer to cred, and not the whole
     cred structure.  Thus you will have to keep the structure allocated
     until you call 'gnutls_deinit()' .

     For 'GNUTLS_CRD_ANON' , 'cred' should be
     'gnutls_anon_client_credentials_t' in case of a client.  In case of
     a server it should be 'gnutls_anon_server_credentials_t' .

     For 'GNUTLS_CRD_SRP' , 'cred' should be
     'gnutls_srp_client_credentials_t' in case of a client, and
     'gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t' , in case of a server.

     For 'GNUTLS_CRD_CERTIFICATE' , 'cred' should be
     'gnutls_certificate_credentials_t' .

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error code is returned.

6.4 Associating the credentials
===============================

* Menu:

* Certificate credentials::
* Raw public-key credentials::
* SRP credentials::
* PSK credentials::

Each authentication method is associated with a key exchange method, and
a credentials type.  The contents of the credentials is
method-dependent, e.g.  certificates for certificate authentication and
should be initialized and associated with a session (see *note
gnutls_credentials_set::).  A mapping of the key exchange methods with
the credential types is shown in *note Table 6.2: tab:key-exchange-cred.

6.4.1 Certificates
------------------

Server certificate authentication
.................................

When using certificates the server is required to have at least one
certificate and private key pair.  Clients may not hold such a pair, but
a server could require it.  In this section we discuss general issues
applying to both client and server certificates.  The next section will
elaborate on issues arising from client authentication only.

In order to use certificate credentials one must first initialize a
credentials structure of type 'gnutls_certificate_credentials_t'.  After
use this structure must be freed.  This can be done with the following
functions.

'INT *note gnutls_certificate_allocate_credentials:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t * RES)'
'VOID *note gnutls_certificate_free_credentials:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t SC)'

After the credentials structures are initialized, the certificate and
key pair must be loaded.  This occurs before any TLS session is
initialized, and the same structures are reused for multiple sessions.
Depending on the certificate type different loading functions are
available, as shown below.  For X.509 certificates, the functions will
accept and use a certificate chain that leads to a trusted authority.
The certificate chain must be ordered in such way that every certificate
certifies the one before it.  The trusted authority's certificate need
not to be included since the peer should possess it already.

'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file2:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const char * CERTFILE, const char * KEYFILE, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE, const char * PASS, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_mem2:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const gnutls_datum_t * CERT, const gnutls_datum_t * KEY, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE, const char * PASS, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, gnutls_x509_crt_t * CERT_LIST, int CERT_LIST_SIZE, gnutls_x509_privkey_t KEY)'

It is recommended to use the higher level functions such as *note
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file2:: which accept not only file names
but URLs that specify objects stored in token, or system certificates
and keys (see *note Application-specific keys::).  For these cases,
another important function is *note
gnutls_certificate_set_pin_function::, that allows setting a callback
function to retrieve a PIN if the input keys are protected by PIN.

 -- Function: void gnutls_certificate_set_pin_function
          (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, gnutls_pin_callback_t
          FN, void * USERDATA)
     CRED: is a 'gnutls_certificate_credentials_t' type.

     FN: A PIN callback

     USERDATA: Data to be passed in the callback

     This function will set a callback function to be used when required
     to access a protected object.  This function overrides any other
     global PIN functions.

     Note that this function must be called right after initialization
     to have effect.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

If the imported keys and certificates need to be accessed before any TLS
session is established, it is convenient to use *note
gnutls_certificate_set_key:: in combination with *note
gnutls_pcert_import_x509_raw:: and *note
gnutls_privkey_import_x509_raw::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_certificate_set_key
          (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const char ** NAMES,
          int NAMES_SIZE, gnutls_pcert_st * PCERT_LIST, int
          PCERT_LIST_SIZE, gnutls_privkey_t KEY)
     RES: is a 'gnutls_certificate_credentials_t' type.

     NAMES: is an array of DNS names belonging to the public-key (NULL
     if none)

     NAMES_SIZE: holds the size of the names list

     PCERT_LIST: contains a certificate list (chain) or raw public-key

     PCERT_LIST_SIZE: holds the size of the certificate list

     KEY: is a 'gnutls_privkey_t' key corresponding to the first
     public-key in pcert_list

     This function sets a public/private key pair in the
     gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type.  The given public key may be
     encapsulated in a certificate or can be given as a raw key.  This
     function may be called more than once, in case multiple key pairs
     exist for the server.  For clients that want to send more than
     their own end- entity certificate (e.g., also an intermediate CA
     cert), the full certificate chain must be provided in 'pcert_list'
     .

     Note that the 'key' will become part of the credentials structure
     and must not be deallocated.  It will be automatically deallocated
     when the 'res' structure is deinitialized.

     If this function fails, the 'res' structure is at an undefined
     state and it must not be reused to load other keys or certificates.

     Note that, this function by default returns zero on success and a
     negative value on error.  Since 3.5.6, when the flag
     'GNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_API_V2' is set using
     'gnutls_certificate_set_flags()' it returns an index (greater or
     equal to zero).  That index can be used for other functions to
     refer to the added key-pair.

     Since GnuTLS 3.6.6 this function also handles raw public keys.

     *Returns:* On success this functions returns zero, and otherwise a
     negative value on error (see above for modifying that behavior).

     *Since:* 3.0

If multiple certificates are used with the functions above each client's
request will be served with the certificate that matches the requested
name (see *note Server name indication::).

As an alternative to loading from files or buffers, a callback may be
used for the server or the client to specify the certificate and the key
at the handshake time.  In that case a certificate should be selected
according the peer's signature algorithm preferences.  To get those
preferences use *note gnutls_sign_algorithm_get_requested::.  Both
functions are shown below.

'VOID *note gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, gnutls_certificate_retrieve_function * FUNC)'
'VOID *note gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function2:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, gnutls_certificate_retrieve_function2 * FUNC)'
'VOID *note gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function3:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, gnutls_certificate_retrieve_function3 * FUNC)'
'INT *note gnutls_sign_algorithm_get_requested:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, size_t INDX, gnutls_sign_algorithm_t * ALGO)'

The functions above do not handle the requested server name
automatically.  A server would need to check the name requested by the
client using *note gnutls_server_name_get::, and serve the appropriate
certificate.  Note that some of these functions require the
'gnutls_pcert_st' structure to be filled in.  Helper functions to fill
in the structure are listed below.

typedef struct gnutls_pcert_st
{
  gnutls_pubkey_t pubkey;
  gnutls_datum_t cert;
  gnutls_certificate_type_t type;
} gnutls_pcert_st;

'INT *note gnutls_pcert_import_x509:: (gnutls_pcert_st * PCERT, gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_pcert_import_x509_raw:: (gnutls_pcert_st * PCERT, const gnutls_datum_t * CERT, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'VOID *note gnutls_pcert_deinit:: (gnutls_pcert_st * PCERT)'

In a handshake, the negotiated cipher suite depends on the certificate's
parameters, so some key exchange methods might not be available with all
certificates.  GnuTLS will disable ciphersuites that are not compatible
with the key, or the enabled authentication methods.  For example keys
marked as sign-only, will not be able to access the plain RSA
ciphersuites, that require decryption.  It is not recommended to use RSA
keys for both signing and encryption.  If possible use a different key
for the 'DHE-RSA' which uses signing and 'RSA' that requires decryption.
All the key exchange methods shown in *note Table 4.1: tab:key-exchange.
are available in certificate authentication.

Client certificate authentication
.................................

If a certificate is to be requested from the client during the
handshake, the server will send a certificate request message.  This
behavior is controlled by *note gnutls_certificate_server_set_request::.
The request contains a list of the by the server accepted certificate
signers.  This list is constructed using the trusted certificate
authorities of the server.  In cases where the server supports a large
number of certificate authorities it makes sense not to advertise all of
the names to save bandwidth.  That can be controlled using the function
*note gnutls_certificate_send_x509_rdn_sequence::.  This however will
have the side-effect of not restricting the client to certificates
signed by server's acceptable signers.

 -- Function: void gnutls_certificate_server_set_request
          (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_certificate_request_t REQ)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     REQ: is one of GNUTLS_CERT_REQUEST, GNUTLS_CERT_REQUIRE,
     GNUTLS_CERT_IGNORE

     This function specifies if we (in case of a server) are going to
     send a certificate request message to the client.  If 'req' is
     GNUTLS_CERT_REQUIRE then the server will return the
     'GNUTLS_E_NO_CERTIFICATE_FOUND' error if the peer does not provide
     a certificate.  If you do not call this function then the client
     will not be asked to send a certificate.  Invoking the function
     with 'req' GNUTLS_CERT_IGNORE has the same effect.

 -- Function: void gnutls_certificate_send_x509_rdn_sequence
          (gnutls_session_t SESSION, int STATUS)
     SESSION: a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     STATUS: is 0 or 1

     If status is non zero, this function will order gnutls not to send
     the rdnSequence in the certificate request message.  That is the
     server will not advertise its trusted CAs to the peer.  If status
     is zero then the default behaviour will take effect, which is to
     advertise the server's trusted CAs.

     This function has no effect in clients, and in authentication
     methods other than certificate with X.509 certificates.

On the client side, it needs to set its certificates on the credentials
structure, similarly to server side from a file, or via a callback.
Once the certificates are available in the credentials structure, the
client will send them if during the handshake the server requests a
certificate signed by the issuer of its CA.

In the case a single certificate is available and the server does not
specify a signer's list, then that certificate is always sent.  It is,
however possible, to send a certificate even when the advertised CA list
by the server contains CAs other than its signer.  That can be achieved
using the 'GNUTLS_FORCE_CLIENT_CERT' flag in *note gnutls_init::.

'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const char * CERTFILE, const char * KEYFILE, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE)'
'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_simple_pkcs12_file:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const char * PKCS12FILE, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE, const char * PASSWORD)'
'VOID *note gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function2:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, gnutls_certificate_retrieve_function2 * FUNC)'

Client or server certificate verification
.........................................

Certificate verification is possible by loading the trusted authorities
into the credentials structure by using the following functions,
applicable to X.509 certificates.  In modern systems it is recommended
to utilize *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_system_trust:: which will
load the trusted authorities from the system store.

 -- Function: int gnutls_certificate_set_x509_system_trust
          (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED)
     CRED: is a 'gnutls_certificate_credentials_t' type.

     This function adds the system's default trusted CAs in order to
     verify client or server certificates.

     In the case the system is currently unsupported
     'GNUTLS_E_UNIMPLEMENTED_FEATURE' is returned.

     *Returns:* the number of certificates processed or a negative error
     code on error.

     *Since:* 3.0.20
'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_file:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, const char * CAFILE, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE)'
'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_dir:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, const char * CA_DIR, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE)'

The peer's certificate will be automatically verified if *note
gnutls_session_set_verify_cert:: is called prior to handshake.

Alternatively, one must set a callback function during the handshake
using *note gnutls_certificate_set_verify_function::, which will verify
the peer's certificate once received.  The verification should happen
using *note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3:: within the callback.  It
will verify the certificate's signature and the owner of the
certificate.  That will provide a brief verification output.  If a
detailed output is required one should call *note
gnutls_certificate_get_peers:: to obtain the raw certificate of the peer
and verify it using the functions discussed in *note X.509
certificates::.

In both the automatic and the manual cases, the verification status
returned can be printed using *note
gnutls_certificate_verification_status_print::.

 -- Function: void gnutls_session_set_verify_cert (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION, const char * HOSTNAME, unsigned FLAGS)
     SESSION: is a gnutls session

     HOSTNAME: is the expected name of the peer; may be 'NULL'

     FLAGS: flags for certificate verification -
     'gnutls_certificate_verify_flags'

     This function instructs GnuTLS to verify the peer's certificate
     using the provided hostname.  If the verification fails the
     handshake will also fail with
     'GNUTLS_E_CERTIFICATE_VERIFICATION_ERROR' .  In that case the
     verification result can be obtained using
     'gnutls_session_get_verify_cert_status()' .

     The 'hostname' pointer provided must remain valid for the lifetime
     of the session.  More precisely it should be available during any
     subsequent handshakes.  If no hostname is provided, no hostname
     verification will be performed.  For a more advanced verification
     function check 'gnutls_session_set_verify_cert2()' .

     If 'flags' is provided which contain a profile, this function
     should be called after any session priority setting functions.

     The 'gnutls_session_set_verify_cert()' function is intended to be
     used by TLS clients to verify the server's certificate.

     *Since:* 3.4.6

'INT *note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, const char * HOSTNAME, unsigned int * STATUS)'
'VOID *note gnutls_certificate_set_verify_function:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, gnutls_certificate_verify_function * FUNC)'

Note that when using raw public-keys verification will not work because
there is no corresponding certificate body belonging to the raw key that
can be verified.  In that case the *note
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers:: family of functions will return a
GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST error code.  For authenticating raw public-keys
one must use an out-of-band mechanism, e.g.  by comparing hashes or
using trust on first use (see *note Verifying a certificate using trust
on first use authentication::).

6.4.2 Raw public-keys
---------------------

As of version 3.6.6 GnuTLS supports *note Raw public-keys::.  With raw
public-keys only the public-key part (that is normally embedded in a
certificate) is transmitted to the peer.  In order to load a raw
public-key and its corresponding private key in a credentials structure
one can use the following functions.

'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_key:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const char ** NAMES, int NAMES_SIZE, gnutls_pcert_st * PCERT_LIST, int PCERT_LIST_SIZE, gnutls_privkey_t KEY)'
'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_rawpk_key_mem:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, const gnutls_datum_t* SPKI, const gnutls_datum_t* PKEY, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, const char* PASS, unsigned int KEY_USAGE, const char ** NAMES, unsigned int NAMES_LENGTH, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_rawpk_key_file:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, const char* RAWPKFILE, const char* PRIVKEYFILE, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, const char * PASS, unsigned int KEY_USAGE, const char ** NAMES, unsigned int NAMES_LENGTH, unsigned int PRIVKEY_FLAGS, unsigned int PKCS11_FLAGS)'

6.4.3 SRP
---------

The initialization functions in SRP credentials differ between client
and server.  Clients supporting SRP should set the username and password
prior to connection, to the credentials structure.  Alternatively *note
gnutls_srp_set_client_credentials_function:: may be used instead, to
specify a callback function that should return the SRP username and
password.  The callback is called once during the TLS handshake.

'INT *note gnutls_srp_allocate_server_credentials:: (gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t * SC)'
'INT *note gnutls_srp_allocate_client_credentials:: (gnutls_srp_client_credentials_t * SC)'
'VOID *note gnutls_srp_free_server_credentials:: (gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t SC)'
'VOID *note gnutls_srp_free_client_credentials:: (gnutls_srp_client_credentials_t SC)'
'INT *note gnutls_srp_set_client_credentials:: (gnutls_srp_client_credentials_t RES, const char * USERNAME, const char * PASSWORD)'

 -- Function: void gnutls_srp_set_client_credentials_function
          (gnutls_srp_client_credentials_t CRED,
          gnutls_srp_client_credentials_function * FUNC)
     CRED: is a 'gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t' type.

     FUNC: is the callback function

     This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the
     username and password for client SRP authentication.  The
     callback's function form is:

     int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, char** username, char**password);

     The 'username' and 'password' must be allocated using
     'gnutls_malloc()' .

     The 'username' should be an ASCII string or UTF-8 string.  In case
     of a UTF-8 string it is recommended to be following the PRECIS
     framework for usernames (rfc8265).  The password can be in ASCII
     format, or normalized using 'gnutls_utf8_password_normalize()' .

     The callback function will be called once per handshake before the
     initial hello message is sent.

     The callback should not return a negative error code the second
     time called, since the handshake procedure will be aborted.

     The callback function should return 0 on success.  -1 indicates an
     error.

In server side the default behavior of GnuTLS is to read the usernames
and SRP verifiers from password files.  These password file format is
compatible the with the _Stanford srp libraries_ format.  If a different
password file format is to be used, then *note
gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_function:: should be called, to set an
appropriate callback.

 -- Function: int gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_file
          (gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t RES, const char *
          PASSWORD_FILE, const char * PASSWORD_CONF_FILE)
     RES: is a 'gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t' type.

     PASSWORD_FILE: is the SRP password file (tpasswd)

     PASSWORD_CONF_FILE: is the SRP password conf file (tpasswd.conf)

     This function sets the password files, in a
     'gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t' type.  Those password files hold
     usernames and verifiers and will be used for SRP authentication.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned, or an
     error code.

 -- Function: void gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_function
          (gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t CRED,
          gnutls_srp_server_credentials_function * FUNC)
     CRED: is a 'gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t' type.

     FUNC: is the callback function

     This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the user's
     SRP credentials.  The callback's function form is:

     int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, const char* username,
     gnutls_datum_t *salt, gnutls_datum_t *verifier, gnutls_datum_t
     *generator, gnutls_datum_t *prime);

     'username' contains the actual username.  The 'salt' , 'verifier' ,
     'generator' and 'prime' must be filled in using the
     'gnutls_malloc()' .  For convenience 'prime' and 'generator' may
     also be one of the static parameters defined in gnutls.h.

     Initially, the data field is NULL in every 'gnutls_datum_t'
     structure that the callback has to fill in.  When the callback is
     done GnuTLS deallocates all of those buffers which are non-NULL,
     regardless of the return value.

     In order to prevent attackers from guessing valid usernames, if a
     user does not exist, g and n values should be filled in using a
     random user's parameters.  In that case the callback must return
     the special value (1).  See 'gnutls_srp_set_server_fake_salt_seed'
     too.  If this is not required for your application, return a
     negative number from the callback to abort the handshake.

     The callback function will only be called once per handshake.  The
     callback function should return 0 on success, while -1 indicates an
     error.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: PSK credentials,  Next: Anonymous credentials,  Prev: SRP credentials,  Up: Associating the credentials

6.4.4 PSK
---------

The initialization functions in PSK credentials differ between client
and server.

'INT *note gnutls_psk_allocate_server_credentials:: (gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t * SC)'
'INT *note gnutls_psk_allocate_client_credentials:: (gnutls_psk_client_credentials_t * SC)'
'VOID *note gnutls_psk_free_server_credentials:: (gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t SC)'
'VOID *note gnutls_psk_free_client_credentials:: (gnutls_psk_client_credentials_t SC)'

Clients supporting PSK should supply the username and key before a TLS
session is established.  Alternatively *note
gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials_function:: can be used to specify a
callback function.  This has the advantage that the callback will be
called only if PSK has been negotiated.

'INT *note gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials:: (gnutls_psk_client_credentials_t RES, const char * USERNAME, const gnutls_datum_t * KEY, gnutls_psk_key_flags FLAGS)'

 -- Function: void gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials_function
          (gnutls_psk_client_credentials_t CRED,
          gnutls_psk_client_credentials_function * FUNC)
     CRED: is a 'gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t' type.

     FUNC: is the callback function

     This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the
     username and password for client PSK authentication.  The
     callback's function form is: int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t,
     char** username, gnutls_datum_t* key);

     The 'username' and 'key' ->data must be allocated using
     'gnutls_malloc()' .  The 'username' should be an ASCII string or
     UTF-8 string.  In case of a UTF-8 string it is recommended to be
     following the PRECIS framework for usernames (rfc8265).

     The callback function will be called once per handshake.

     The callback function should return 0 on success.  -1 indicates an
     error.

In server side the default behavior of GnuTLS is to read the usernames
and PSK keys from a password file.  The password file should contain
usernames and keys in hexadecimal format.  The name of the password file
can be stored to the credentials structure by calling *note
gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_file::.  If a different password file
format is to be used, then a callback should be set instead by *note
gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_function::.

The server can help the client chose a suitable username and password,
by sending a hint.  Note that there is no common profile for the PSK
hint and applications are discouraged to use it.  A server, may specify
the hint by calling *note gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_hint::.  The
client can retrieve the hint, for example in the callback function,
using *note gnutls_psk_client_get_hint::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_file
          (gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t RES, const char *
          PASSWORD_FILE)
     RES: is a 'gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t' type.

     PASSWORD_FILE: is the PSK password file (passwd.psk)

     This function sets the password file, in a
     'gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t' type.  This password file holds
     usernames and keys and will be used for PSK authentication.

6.5 Setting up the transport layer
==================================

The next step is to setup the underlying transport layer details.  The
Berkeley sockets are implicitly used by GnuTLS, thus a call to *note
gnutls_transport_set_int:: would be sufficient to specify the socket
descriptor.

'VOID *note gnutls_transport_set_int:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, int FD)'
'VOID *note gnutls_transport_set_int2:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, int RECV_FD, int SEND_FD)'

If however another transport layer than TCP is selected, then a pointer
should be used instead to express the parameter to be passed to custom
functions.  In that case the following functions should be used instead.

'VOID *note gnutls_transport_set_ptr:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_transport_ptr_t PTR)'
'VOID *note gnutls_transport_set_ptr2:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_transport_ptr_t RECV_PTR, gnutls_transport_ptr_t SEND_PTR)'

Moreover all of the following push and pull callbacks should be set.

 -- Function: void gnutls_transport_set_push_function (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION, gnutls_push_func PUSH_FUNC)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     PUSH_FUNC: a callback function similar to 'write()'

     This is the function where you set a push function for gnutls to
     use in order to send data.  If you are going to use berkeley style
     sockets, you do not need to use this function since the default
     send(2) will probably be ok.  Otherwise you should specify this
     function for gnutls to be able to send data.  The callback should
     return a positive number indicating the bytes sent, and -1 on
     error.

     'push_func' is of the form, ssize_t
     (*gnutls_push_func)(gnutls_transport_ptr_t, const void*, size_t);

 -- Function: void gnutls_transport_set_vec_push_function
          (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_vec_push_func VEC_FUNC)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     VEC_FUNC: a callback function similar to 'writev()'

     Using this function you can override the default writev(2) function
     for gnutls to send data.  Setting this callback instead of
     'gnutls_transport_set_push_function()' is recommended since it
     introduces less overhead in the TLS handshake process.

     'vec_func' is of the form, ssize_t (*gnutls_vec_push_func)
     (gnutls_transport_ptr_t, const giovec_t * iov, int iovcnt);

     *Since:* 2.12.0

 -- Function: void gnutls_transport_set_pull_function (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION, gnutls_pull_func PULL_FUNC)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     PULL_FUNC: a callback function similar to 'read()'

     This is the function where you set a function for gnutls to receive
     data.  Normally, if you use berkeley style sockets, do not need to
     use this function since the default recv(2) will probably be ok.
     The callback should return 0 on connection termination, a positive
     number indicating the number of bytes received, and -1 on error.

     'gnutls_pull_func' is of the form, ssize_t
     (*gnutls_pull_func)(gnutls_transport_ptr_t, void*, size_t);

 -- Function: void gnutls_transport_set_pull_timeout_function
          (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_pull_timeout_func FUNC)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     FUNC: a callback function

     This is the function where you set a function for gnutls to know
     whether data are ready to be received.  It should wait for data a
     given time frame in milliseconds.  The callback should return 0 on
     timeout, a positive number if data can be received, and -1 on
     error.  You'll need to override this function if 'select()' is not
     suitable for the provided transport calls.

     As with 'select()' , if the timeout value is zero the callback
     should return zero if no data are immediately available.  The
     special value 'GNUTLS_INDEFINITE_TIMEOUT' indicates that the
     callback should wait indefinitely for data.

     'gnutls_pull_timeout_func' is of the form, int
     (*gnutls_pull_timeout_func)(gnutls_transport_ptr_t, unsigned int
     ms);

     This callback is necessary when 'gnutls_handshake_set_timeout()' or
     'gnutls_record_set_timeout()' are set, under TLS1.3 and for
     enforcing the DTLS mode timeouts when in blocking mode.

     For compatibility with future GnuTLS versions this callback must be
     set when a custom pull function is registered.  The callback will
     not be used when the session is in TLS mode with non-blocking
     sockets.  That is, when 'GNUTLS_NONBLOCK' is specified for a TLS
     session in 'gnutls_init()' .

     The helper function 'gnutls_system_recv_timeout()' is provided to
     simplify writing callbacks.

     *Since:* 3.0

The functions above accept a callback function which should return the
number of bytes written, or -1 on error and should set 'errno'
appropriately.  In some environments, setting 'errno' is unreliable.
For example Windows have several errno variables in different CRTs, or
in other systems it may be a non thread-local variable.  If this is a
concern to you, call *note gnutls_transport_set_errno:: with the
intended errno value instead of setting 'errno' directly.

 -- Function: void gnutls_transport_set_errno (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          int ERR)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     ERR: error value to store in session-specific errno variable.

     Store 'err' in the session-specific errno variable.  Useful values
     for 'err' are EINTR, EAGAIN and EMSGSIZE, other values are treated
     will be treated as real errors in the push/pull function.

     This function is useful in replacement push and pull functions set
     by 'gnutls_transport_set_push_function()' and
     'gnutls_transport_set_pull_function()' under Windows, where the
     replacements may not have access to the same 'errno' variable that
     is used by GnuTLS (e.g., the application is linked to msvcr71.dll
     and gnutls is linked to msvcrt.dll).

     This function is unreliable if you are using the same 'session' in
     different threads for sending and receiving.

GnuTLS currently only interprets the EINTR, EAGAIN and EMSGSIZE errno
values and returns the corresponding GnuTLS error codes:
   * 'GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED'
   * 'GNUTLS_E_AGAIN'
   * 'GNUTLS_E_LARGE_PACKET'
The EINTR and EAGAIN values are returned by interrupted system calls, or
when non blocking IO is used.  All GnuTLS functions can be resumed
(called again), if any of the above error codes is returned.  The
EMSGSIZE value is returned when attempting to send a large datagram.

In the case of DTLS it is also desirable to override the generic
transport functions with functions that emulate the operation of
'recvfrom' and 'sendto'.  In addition DTLS requires timers during the
receive of a handshake message, set using the *note
gnutls_transport_set_pull_timeout_function:: function.  To check the
retransmission timers the function *note gnutls_dtls_get_timeout:: is
provided, which returns the time remaining until the next
retransmission, or better the time until *note gnutls_handshake:: should
be called again.

 -- Function: void gnutls_transport_set_pull_timeout_function
          (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_pull_timeout_func FUNC)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     FUNC: a callback function

     This is the function where you set a function for gnutls to know
     whether data are ready to be received.  It should wait for data a
     given time frame in milliseconds.  The callback should return 0 on
     timeout, a positive number if data can be received, and -1 on
     error.  You'll need to override this function if 'select()' is not
     suitable for the provided transport calls.

     As with 'select()' , if the timeout value is zero the callback
     should return zero if no data are immediately available.  The
     special value 'GNUTLS_INDEFINITE_TIMEOUT' indicates that the
     callback should wait indefinitely for data.

     'gnutls_pull_timeout_func' is of the form, int
     (*gnutls_pull_timeout_func)(gnutls_transport_ptr_t, unsigned int
     ms);

     This callback is necessary when 'gnutls_handshake_set_timeout()' or
     'gnutls_record_set_timeout()' are set, under TLS1.3 and for
     enforcing the DTLS mode timeouts when in blocking mode.

     For compatibility with future GnuTLS versions this callback must be
     set when a custom pull function is registered.  The callback will
     not be used when the session is in TLS mode with non-blocking
     sockets.  That is, when 'GNUTLS_NONBLOCK' is specified for a TLS
     session in 'gnutls_init()' .

     The helper function 'gnutls_system_recv_timeout()' is provided to
     simplify writing callbacks.

     *Since:* 3.0

 -- Function: unsigned int gnutls_dtls_get_timeout (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     This function will return the milliseconds remaining for a
     retransmission of the previously sent handshake message.  This
     function is useful when DTLS is used in non-blocking mode, to
     estimate when to call 'gnutls_handshake()' if no packets have been
     received.

     *Returns:* the remaining time in milliseconds.

6.5.1 Asynchronous operation
----------------------------

GnuTLS can be used with asynchronous socket or event-driven programming.
The approach is similar to using Berkeley sockets under such an
environment.  The blocking, due to network interaction, calls such as
*note gnutls_handshake::, *note gnutls_record_recv::, can be set to
non-blocking by setting the underlying sockets to non-blocking.  If
other push and pull functions are setup, then they should behave the
same way as 'recv' and 'send' when used in a non-blocking way, i.e.,
return -1 and set errno to 'EAGAIN'.  Since, during a TLS protocol
session GnuTLS does not block except for network interaction, the non
blocking 'EAGAIN' errno will be propagated and GnuTLS functions will
return the 'GNUTLS_E_AGAIN' error code.  Such calls can be resumed the
same way as a system call would.  The only exception is *note
gnutls_record_send::, which if interrupted subsequent calls need not to
include the data to be sent (can be called with NULL argument).

When using the 'poll' or 'select' system calls though, one should
remember that they only apply to the kernel sockets API. To check for
any available buffered data in a GnuTLS session, utilize *note
gnutls_record_check_pending::, either before the 'poll' system call, or
after a call to *note gnutls_record_recv::.  Data queued by *note
gnutls_record_send:: (when interrupted) can be discarded using *note
gnutls_record_discard_queued::.

An example of GnuTLS' usage with asynchronous operation can be found in
'doc/examples/tlsproxy'.

The following paragraphs describe the detailed requirements for
non-blocking operation when using the TLS or DTLS protocols.

6.5.1.1 TLS protocol
....................

There are no special requirements for the TLS protocol operation in
non-blocking mode if a non-blocking socket is used.

It is recommended, however, for future compatibility, when in
non-blocking mode, to call the *note gnutls_init:: function with the
'GNUTLS_NONBLOCK' flag set (see *note Session initialization::).

6.5.1.2 Datagram TLS protocol
.............................

When in non-blocking mode the function, the *note gnutls_init:: function
must be called with the 'GNUTLS_NONBLOCK' flag set (see *note Session
initialization::).

In contrast with the TLS protocol, the pull timeout function is
required, but will only be called with a timeout of zero.  In that case
it should indicate whether there are data to be received or not.  When
not using the default pull function, then *note
gnutls_transport_set_pull_timeout_function:: should be called.

Although in the TLS protocol implementation each call to receive or send
function implies to restoring the same function that was interrupted, in
the DTLS protocol this requirement isn't true.  There are cases where a
retransmission is required, which are indicated by a received message
and thus *note gnutls_record_get_direction:: must be called to decide
which direction to check prior to restoring a function call.

 -- Function: int gnutls_record_get_direction (gnutls_session_t SESSION)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     This function is useful to determine whether a GnuTLS function was
     interrupted while sending or receiving, so that 'select()' or
     'poll()' may be called appropriately.

     It provides information about the internals of the record protocol
     and is only useful if a prior gnutls function call, e.g.
     'gnutls_handshake()' , was interrupted and returned
     'GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED' or 'GNUTLS_E_AGAIN' .  After such an
     interrupt applications may call 'select()' or 'poll()' before
     restoring the interrupted GnuTLS function.

     This function's output is unreliable if you are using the same
     'session' in different threads for sending and receiving.

     *Returns:* 0 if interrupted while trying to read data, or 1 while
     trying to write data.

When calling *note gnutls_handshake:: through a multi-plexer, to be able
to handle properly the DTLS handshake retransmission timers, the
function *note gnutls_dtls_get_timeout:: should be used to estimate when
to call *note gnutls_handshake:: if no data have been received.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Reducing round-trips,  Next: Zero-roundtrip mode,  Prev: Asynchronous operation,  Up: Setting up the transport layer

6.5.2 Reducing round-trips
--------------------------

The full TLS 1.2 handshake requires 2 round-trips to complete, and when
combined with TCP's SYN and SYN-ACK negotiation it extends to 3 full
round-trips.  While, TLS 1.3 reduces that to two round-trips when under
TCP, it still adds considerable latency, making the protocol unsuitable
for certain applications.

To optimize the handshake latency, in client side, it is possible to
take advantage of the TCP fast open [*note RFC7413::] mechanism on
operating systems that support it.  That can be done either by manually
crafting the push and pull callbacks, or by utilizing *note
gnutls_transport_set_fastopen::.  In that case the initial TCP handshake
is eliminated, reducing the TLS 1.2 handshake round-trip to 2, and the
TLS 1.3 handshake to a single round-trip.  Note, that when this function
is used, any connection failures will be reported during the *note
gnutls_handshake:: function call with error code 'GNUTLS_E_PUSH_ERROR'.

 -- Function: void gnutls_transport_set_fastopen (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION, int FD, struct sockaddr * CONNECT_ADDR, socklen_t
          CONNECT_ADDRLEN, unsigned int FLAGS)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     FD: is the session's socket descriptor

     CONNECT_ADDR: is the address we want to connect to

     CONNECT_ADDRLEN: is the length of 'connect_addr'

     FLAGS: must be zero

     Enables TCP Fast Open (TFO) for the specified TLS client session.
     That means that TCP connection establishment and the transmission
     of the first TLS client hello packet are combined.  The peer's
     address must be specified in 'connect_addr' and 'connect_addrlen' ,
     and the socket specified by 'fd' should not be connected.

     TFO only works for TCP sockets of type AF_INET and AF_INET6.  If
     the OS doesn't support TCP fast open this function will result to
     gnutls using 'connect()' transparently during the first write.

     *Note:* This function overrides all the transport callback
     functions.  If this is undesirable, TCP Fast Open must be
     implemented on the user callback functions without calling this
     function.  When using this function, transport callbacks must not
     be set, and 'gnutls_transport_set_ptr()' or
     'gnutls_transport_set_int()' must not be called.

     On GNU/Linux TFO has to be enabled at the system layer, that is in
     /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fastopen, bit 0 has to be set.

     This function has no effect on server sessions.

     *Since:* 3.5.3

When restricted to TLS 1.2, and non-resumed sessions, it is possible to
further reduce the round-trips to a single one by taking advantage of
the *note False Start:: TLS extension.  This can be enabled by setting
the GNUTLS_ENABLE_FALSE_START flag on *note gnutls_init::.

Under TLS 1.3, the server side can start transmitting before the
handshake is complete (i.e., while the client Finished message is still
in flight), when no client certificate authentication is requested.
This, unlike false start, is part of protocol design with no known
security implications.  It can be enabled by setting the
GNUTLS_ENABLE_EARLY_START on *note gnutls_init::, and the *note
gnutls_handshake:: function will return early, allowing the server to
send data earlier.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Zero-roundtrip mode,  Next: Anti-replay protection,  Prev: Reducing round-trips,  Up: Setting up the transport layer

6.5.3 Zero-roundtrip mode
-------------------------

Under TLS 1.3, when the client has already connected to the server and
is resuming a session, it can start transmitting application data during
handshake.  This is called zero round-trip time (0-RTT) mode, and the
application data sent in this mode is called early data.  The client can
send early data with *note gnutls_record_send_early_data::.  The client
should call this function before calling *note gnutls_handshake:: and
after calling *note gnutls_session_set_data::.

Note, however, that early data has weaker security properties than
normal application data sent after handshake, such as lack of forward
secrecy, no guarantees of non-replay between connections.  Thus it is
disabled on the server side by default.  To enable it, the server needs
to:
  1. Set GNUTLS_ENABLE_EARLY_DATA on *note gnutls_init::.  Note that
     this option only has effect on server.

  2. Enable anti-replay measure.  See *note Anti-replay protection:: for
     the details.

The server caches the received early data until it is read.  To set the
maximum amount of data to be stored in the cache, use *note
gnutls_record_set_max_early_data_size::.  After receiving the
EndOfEarlyData handshake message, the server can start retrieving the
received data with *note gnutls_record_recv_early_data::.  You can call
the function either after the handshake is complete, or through a
handshake hook (*note gnutls_handshake_set_hook_function::).

When sending early data, the client should respect the maximum amount of
early data, which may have been previously advertised by the server.  It
can be checked using *note gnutls_record_get_max_early_data_size::,
right after calling *note gnutls_session_set_data::.

After sending early data, to check whether the sent early data was
accepted by the server, use *note gnutls_session_get_flags:: and compare
the result with GNUTLS_SFLAGS_EARLY_DATA.  Similarly, on the server
side, the same function and flag can be used to check whether it has
actually accepted early data.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Anti-replay protection,  Next: DTLS sessions,  Prev: Zero-roundtrip mode,  Up: Setting up the transport layer

6.5.4 Anti-replay protection
----------------------------

When 0-RTT mode is used, the server must protect itself from replay
attacks, where adversary client reuses duplicate session ticket to send
early data, before the server authenticates the client.

GnuTLS provides a simple mechanism against replay attacks, following the
method called ClientHello recording.  When a session ticket is accepted,
the server checks if the ClientHello message has been already seen.  If
there is a duplicate, the server rejects early data.

The problem of this approach is that the number of recorded messages
grows indefinitely.  To prevent that, the server can limit the recording
to a certain time window, which can be configured with *note
gnutls_anti_replay_set_window::.

The anti-replay mechanism shall be globally initialized with *note
gnutls_anti_replay_init::, and then attached to a session using *note
gnutls_anti_replay_enable::.  It can be deinitialized with *note
gnutls_anti_replay_deinit::.

The server must also set up a database back-end to store ClientHello
messages.  That can be achieved using *note
gnutls_anti_replay_set_add_function:: and *note
gnutls_anti_replay_set_ptr::.

Note that, if the back-end stores arbitrary number of ClientHello, it
needs to periodically clean up the stored entries based on the time
window set with *note gnutls_anti_replay_set_window::.  The cleanup can
be implemented by iterating through the database entries and calling
*note gnutls_db_check_entry_expire_time::.  This is similar to session
database cleanup used by TLS1.2 sessions.

The full set up of the server using early data would be like the
following example:
     #define MAX_EARLY_DATA_SIZE 16384

     static int
     db_add_func(void *dbf, gnutls_datum_t key, gnutls_datum_t data)
     {
         /* Return GNUTLS_E_DB_ENTRY_EXISTS, if KEY is found in the database.
          * Otherwise, store it and return 0.
          */
     }

     static int
     handshake_hook_func(gnutls_session_t session, unsigned int htype,
                         unsigned when, unsigned int incoming, const gnutls_datum_t *msg)
     {
         int ret;
         char buf[MAX_EARLY_DATA_SIZE];

         assert(htype == GNUTLS_HANDSHAKE_END_OF_EARLY_DATA);
         assert(when == GNUTLS_HOOK_POST);

         if (gnutls_session_get_flags(session) & GNUTLS_SFLAGS_EARLY_DATA) {
             ret = gnutls_record_recv_early_data(session, buf, sizeof(buf));
             assert(ret >= 0);
         }

         return ret;
     }

     int main()
     {
       ...
       /* Initialize anti-replay measure, which can be shared
        * among multiple sessions.
        */
       gnutls_anti_replay_init(&anti_replay);

       /* Set the database back-end function for the anti-replay data. */
       gnutls_anti_replay_set_add_function(anti_replay, db_add_func);
       gnutls_anti_replay_set_ptr(anti_replay, NULL);

       ...

       gnutls_init(&server, GNUTLS_SERVER | GNUTLS_ENABLE_EARLY_DATA);
       gnutls_record_set_max_early_data_size(server, MAX_EARLY_DATA_SIZE);

       ...

       /* Set the anti-replay measure to the session.
        */
       gnutls_anti_replay_enable(server, anti_replay);
       ...

       /* Retrieve early data in a handshake hook;
        * you can also do that after handshake.
        */
       gnutls_handshake_set_hook_function(server, GNUTLS_HANDSHAKE_END_OF_EARLY_DATA,
                                          GNUTLS_HOOK_POST, handshake_hook_func);
       ...
     }

6.5.5 DTLS sessions
-------------------

Because datagram TLS can operate over connections where the client
cannot be reliably verified, functionality in the form of cookies, is
available to prevent denial of service attacks to servers.  GnuTLS
requires a server to generate a secret key that is used to sign a
cookie(1).  That cookie is sent to the client using *note
gnutls_dtls_cookie_send::, and the client must reply using the correct
cookie.  The server side should verify the initial message sent by
client using *note gnutls_dtls_cookie_verify::.  If successful the
session should be initialized and associated with the cookie using *note
gnutls_dtls_prestate_set::, before proceeding to the handshake.

'INT *note gnutls_dtls_cookie_send:: (gnutls_datum_t * KEY, void * CLIENT_DATA, size_t CLIENT_DATA_SIZE, gnutls_dtls_prestate_st * PRESTATE, gnutls_transport_ptr_t PTR, gnutls_push_func PUSH_FUNC)'

'VOID *note gnutls_dtls_prestate_set:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_dtls_prestate_st * PRESTATE)'

Note that the above apply to server side only and they are not mandatory
to be used.  Not using them, however, allows denial of service attacks.
The client side cookie handling is part of *note gnutls_handshake::.

Datagrams are typically restricted by a maximum transfer unit (MTU). For
that both client and server side should set the correct maximum transfer
unit for the layer underneath GnuTLS.  This will allow proper
fragmentation of DTLS messages and prevent messages from being silently
discarded by the transport layer.  The "correct" maximum transfer unit
can be obtained through a path MTU discovery mechanism [*note
RFC4821::].

6.5.6 DTLS and SCTP
-------------------

Although DTLS can run under any reliable or unreliable layer, there are
special requirements for SCTP according to [*note RFC6083::].  We
summarize the most important below, however for a full treatment we
refer to [*note RFC6083::].

   * The MTU set via *note gnutls_dtls_set_mtu:: must be 2^14.
   * Replay detection must be disabled; use the flag
     'GNUTLS_NO_REPLAY_PROTECTION' with *note gnutls_init::.
   * Retransmission of messages must be disabled; use *note
     gnutls_dtls_set_timeouts:: with a retransmission timeout larger
     than the total.
   * Handshake, Alert and ChangeCipherSpec messages must be sent over
     stream 0 with unlimited reliability and with the ordered delivery
     feature.
   * During a rehandshake, the caching of messages with unknown epoch is
     not handled by GnuTLS; this must be implemented in a special pull
     function.

6.6 TLS handshake
=================

Once a session has been initialized and a network connection has been
set up, TLS and DTLS protocols perform a handshake.  The handshake is
the actual key exchange.

 -- Function: int gnutls_handshake (gnutls_session_t SESSION)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     This function performs the handshake of the TLS/SSL protocol, and
     initializes the TLS session parameters.

     The non-fatal errors expected by this function are:
     'GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED' , 'GNUTLS_E_AGAIN' ,
     'GNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED' .  When this function is called
     for re-handshake under TLS 1.2 or earlier, the non-fatal error code
     'GNUTLS_E_GOT_APPLICATION_DATA' may also be returned.

     The former two interrupt the handshake procedure due to the
     transport layer being interrupted, and the latter because of a
     "warning" alert that was sent by the peer (it is always a good idea
     to check any received alerts).  On these non-fatal errors call this
     function again, until it returns 0; cf.
     'gnutls_record_get_direction()' and 'gnutls_error_is_fatal()' .  In
     DTLS sessions the non-fatal error 'GNUTLS_E_LARGE_PACKET' is also
     possible, and indicates that the MTU should be adjusted.

     When this function is called by a server after a rehandshake
     request under TLS 1.2 or earlier the
     'GNUTLS_E_GOT_APPLICATION_DATA' error code indicates that some data
     were pending prior to peer initiating the handshake.  Under TLS 1.3
     this function when called after a successful handshake, is a no-op
     and always succeeds in server side; in client side this function is
     equivalent to 'gnutls_session_key_update()' with 'GNUTLS_KU_PEER'
     flag.

     This function handles both full and abbreviated TLS handshakes
     (resumption).  For abbreviated handshakes, in client side, the
     'gnutls_session_set_data()' should be called prior to this function
     to set parameters from a previous session.  In server side,
     resumption is handled by either setting a DB back-end, or setting
     up keys for session tickets.

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' on a successful handshake, otherwise
     a negative error code.

 -- Function: void gnutls_handshake_set_timeout (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION, unsigned int MS)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     MS: is a timeout value in milliseconds

     This function sets the timeout for the TLS handshake process to the
     provided value.  Use an 'ms' value of zero to disable timeout, or
     'GNUTLS_DEFAULT_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT' for a reasonable default value.
     For the DTLS protocol, the more detailed
     'gnutls_dtls_set_timeouts()' is provided.

     This function requires to set a pull timeout callback.  See
     'gnutls_transport_set_pull_timeout_function()' .

     *Since:* 3.1.0

In GnuTLS 3.5.0 and later it is recommended to use *note
gnutls_session_set_verify_cert:: for the handshake process to ensure the
verification of the peer's identity.  That will verify the peer's
certificate, against the trusted CA store while accounting for stapled
OCSP responses during the handshake; any error will be returned as a
handshake error.

In older GnuTLS versions it is required to verify the peer's certificate
during the handshake by setting a callback with *note
gnutls_certificate_set_verify_function::, and then using *note
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3:: from it.  See *note Certificate
authentication:: for more information.

'VOID *note gnutls_session_set_verify_cert:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, const char * HOSTNAME, unsigned FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, const char * HOSTNAME, unsigned int * STATUS)'


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Data transfer and termination,  Next: Buffered data transfer,  Prev: TLS handshake,  Up: How to use GnuTLS in applications

6.7 Data transfer and termination
=================================

Once the handshake is complete and peer's identity has been verified
data can be exchanged.  The available functions resemble the POSIX
'recv' and 'send' functions.  It is suggested to use *note
gnutls_error_is_fatal:: to check whether the error codes returned by
these functions are fatal for the protocol or can be ignored.

 -- Function: ssize_t gnutls_record_send (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          const void * DATA, size_t DATA_SIZE)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     DATA: contains the data to send

     DATA_SIZE: is the length of the data

     This function has the similar semantics with 'send()' .  The only
     difference is that it accepts a GnuTLS session, and uses different
     error codes.  Note that if the send buffer is full, 'send()' will
     block this function.  See the 'send()' documentation for more
     information.

     You can replace the default push function which is 'send()' , by
     using 'gnutls_transport_set_push_function()' .

     If the EINTR is returned by the internal push function then
     'GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED' will be returned.  If 'GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED'
     or 'GNUTLS_E_AGAIN' is returned, you must call this function again
     with the exact same parameters, or provide a 'NULL' pointer for
     'data' and 0 for 'data_size' , in order to write the same data as
     before.  If you wish to discard the previous data instead of
     retrying, you must call 'gnutls_record_discard_queued()' before
     calling this function with different parameters.  cf.
     'gnutls_record_get_direction()' .

     Note that in DTLS this function will return the
     'GNUTLS_E_LARGE_PACKET' error code if the send data exceed the data
     MTU value - as returned by 'gnutls_dtls_get_data_mtu()' .  The
     errno value EMSGSIZE also maps to 'GNUTLS_E_LARGE_PACKET' .  Note
     that since 3.2.13 this function can be called under cork in DTLS
     mode, and will refuse to send data over the MTU size by returning
     'GNUTLS_E_LARGE_PACKET' .

     *Returns:* The number of bytes sent, or a negative error code.  The
     number of bytes sent might be less than 'data_size' .  The maximum
     number of bytes this function can send in a single call depends on
     the negotiated maximum record size.

 -- Function: ssize_t gnutls_record_recv (gnutls_session_t SESSION, void
          * DATA, size_t DATA_SIZE)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     DATA: the buffer that the data will be read into

     DATA_SIZE: the number of requested bytes

     This function has the similar semantics with 'recv()' .  The only
     difference is that it accepts a GnuTLS session, and uses different
     error codes.  In the special case that the peer requests a
     renegotiation, the caller will receive an error code of
     'GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE' .  In case of a client, this message may be
     simply ignored, replied with an alert 'GNUTLS_A_NO_RENEGOTIATION' ,
     or replied with a new handshake, depending on the client's will.  A
     server receiving this error code can only initiate a new handshake
     or terminate the session.

     If 'EINTR' is returned by the internal pull function (the default
     is 'recv()' ) then 'GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED' will be returned.  If
     'GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED' or 'GNUTLS_E_AGAIN' is returned, you must
     call this function again to get the data.  See also
     'gnutls_record_get_direction()' .

     *Returns:* The number of bytes received and zero on EOF (for stream
     connections).  A negative error code is returned in case of an
     error.  The number of bytes received might be less than the
     requested 'data_size' .

 -- Function: int gnutls_error_is_fatal (int ERROR)
     ERROR: is a GnuTLS error code, a negative error code

     If a GnuTLS function returns a negative error code you may feed
     that value to this function to see if the error condition is fatal
     to a TLS session (i.e., must be terminated).

     Note that you may also want to check the error code manually, since
     some non-fatal errors to the protocol (such as a warning alert or a
     rehandshake request) may be fatal for your program.

     This function is only useful if you are dealing with errors from
     functions that relate to a TLS session (e.g., record layer or
     handshake layer handling functions).

     *Returns:* Non-zero value on fatal errors or zero on non-fatal.

Although, in the TLS protocol the receive function can be called at any
time, when DTLS is used the GnuTLS receive functions must be called once
a message is available for reading, even if no data are expected.  This
is because in DTLS various (internal) actions may be required due to
retransmission timers.  Moreover, an extended receive function is shown
below, which allows the extraction of the message's sequence number.
Due to the unreliable nature of the protocol, this field allows
distinguishing out-of-order messages.

 -- Function: ssize_t gnutls_record_recv_seq (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          void * DATA, size_t DATA_SIZE, unsigned char * SEQ)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     DATA: the buffer that the data will be read into

     DATA_SIZE: the number of requested bytes

     SEQ: is the packet's 64-bit sequence number.  Should have space for
     8 bytes.

     This function is the same as 'gnutls_record_recv()' , except that
     it returns in addition to data, the sequence number of the data.
     This is useful in DTLS where record packets might be received
     out-of-order.  The returned 8-byte sequence number is an integer in
     big-endian format and should be treated as a unique message
     identification.

     *Returns:* The number of bytes received and zero on EOF. A negative
     error code is returned in case of an error.  The number of bytes
     received might be less than 'data_size' .

     *Since:* 3.0

The *note gnutls_record_check_pending:: helper function is available to
allow checking whether data are available to be read in a GnuTLS session
buffers.  Note that this function complements but does not replace
'poll', i.e., *note gnutls_record_check_pending:: reports no data to be
read, 'poll' should be called to check for data in the network buffers.

 -- Function: size_t gnutls_record_check_pending (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     This function checks if there are unread data in the gnutls
     buffers.  If the return value is non-zero the next call to
     'gnutls_record_recv()' is guaranteed not to block.

     *Returns:* Returns the size of the data or zero.
'INT *note gnutls_record_get_direction:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION)'

Once a TLS or DTLS session is no longer needed, it is recommended to use
*note gnutls_bye:: to terminate the session.  That way the peer is
notified securely about the intention of termination, which allows
distinguishing it from a malicious connection termination.  A session
can be deinitialized with the *note gnutls_deinit:: function.

 -- Function: int gnutls_bye (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          gnutls_close_request_t HOW)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     HOW: is an integer

     Terminates the current TLS/SSL connection.  The connection should
     have been initiated using 'gnutls_handshake()' .  'how' should be
     one of 'GNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR' , 'GNUTLS_SHUT_WR' .

     In case of 'GNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR' the TLS session gets terminated and
     further receives and sends will be disallowed.  If the return value
     is zero you may continue using the underlying transport layer.
     'GNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR' sends an alert containing a close request and
     waits for the peer to reply with the same message.

     In case of 'GNUTLS_SHUT_WR' the TLS session gets terminated and
     further sends will be disallowed.  In order to reuse the connection
     you should wait for an EOF from the peer.  'GNUTLS_SHUT_WR' sends
     an alert containing a close request.

     Note that not all implementations will properly terminate a TLS
     connection.  Some of them, usually for performance reasons, will
     terminate only the underlying transport layer, and thus not
     distinguishing between a malicious party prematurely terminating
     the connection and normal termination.

     This function may also return 'GNUTLS_E_AGAIN' or
     'GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED' ; cf.  'gnutls_record_get_direction()' .

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' on success, or an error code, see
     function documentation for entire semantics.

 -- Function: void gnutls_deinit (gnutls_session_t SESSION)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     This function clears all buffers associated with the 'session' .
     This function will also remove session data from the session
     database if the session was terminated abnormally.

6.8 Buffered data transfer
==========================

Although *note gnutls_record_send:: is sufficient to transmit data to
the peer, when many small chunks of data are to be transmitted it is
inefficient and wastes bandwidth due to the TLS record overhead.  In
that case it is preferable to combine the small chunks before
transmission.  The following functions provide that functionality.

 -- Function: void gnutls_record_cork (gnutls_session_t SESSION)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     If called, 'gnutls_record_send()' will no longer send any records.
     Any sent records will be cached until 'gnutls_record_uncork()' is
     called.

     This function is safe to use with DTLS after GnuTLS 3.3.0.

     *Since:* 3.1.9

 -- Function: int gnutls_record_uncork (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          unsigned int FLAGS)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     FLAGS: Could be zero or 'GNUTLS_RECORD_WAIT'

     This resets the effect of 'gnutls_record_cork()' , and flushes any
     pending data.  If the 'GNUTLS_RECORD_WAIT' flag is specified then
     this function will block until the data is sent or a fatal error
     occurs (i.e., the function will retry on 'GNUTLS_E_AGAIN' and
     'GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED' ).

     If the flag 'GNUTLS_RECORD_WAIT' is not specified and the function
     is interrupted then the 'GNUTLS_E_AGAIN' or 'GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED'
     errors will be returned.  To obtain the data left in the corked
     buffer use 'gnutls_record_check_corked()' .

     *Returns:* On success the number of transmitted data is returned,
     or otherwise a negative error code.

     *Since:* 3.1.9


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Handling alerts,  Next: Priority Strings,  Prev: Buffered data transfer,  Up: How to use GnuTLS in applications

6.9 Handling alerts
===================

During a TLS connection alert messages may be exchanged by the two
peers.  Those messages may be fatal, meaning the connection must be
terminated afterwards, or warning when something needs to be reported to
the peer, but without interrupting the session.  The error codes
'GNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED' or 'GNUTLS_E_FATAL_ALERT_RECEIVED'
signal those alerts when received, and may be returned by all GnuTLS
functions that receive data from the peer, being *note
gnutls_handshake:: and *note gnutls_record_recv::.

If those error codes are received the alert and its level should be
logged or reported to the peer using the functions below.

 -- Function: gnutls_alert_description_t gnutls_alert_get
          (gnutls_session_t SESSION)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     This function will return the last alert number received.  This
     function should be called when 'GNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED' or
     'GNUTLS_E_FATAL_ALERT_RECEIVED' errors are returned by a gnutls
     function.  The peer may send alerts if he encounters an error.  If
     no alert has been received the returned value is undefined.

     *Returns:* the last alert received, a 'gnutls_alert_description_t'
     value.

 -- Function: const char * gnutls_alert_get_name
          (gnutls_alert_description_t ALERT)
     ALERT: is an alert number.

     This function will return a string that describes the given alert
     number, or 'NULL' .  See 'gnutls_alert_get()' .

     *Returns:* string corresponding to 'gnutls_alert_description_t'
     value.

The peer may also be warned or notified of a fatal issue by using one of
the functions below.  All the available alerts are listed in *note The
Alert Protocol::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_alert_send (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          gnutls_alert_level_t LEVEL, gnutls_alert_description_t DESC)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     LEVEL: is the level of the alert

     DESC: is the alert description

     This function will send an alert to the peer in order to inform him
     of something important (eg.  his Certificate could not be
     verified).  If the alert level is Fatal then the peer is expected
     to close the connection, otherwise he may ignore the alert and
     continue.

     The error code of the underlying record send function will be
     returned, so you may also receive 'GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED' or
     'GNUTLS_E_AGAIN' as well.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise an error code is returned.

 -- Function: int gnutls_error_to_alert (int ERR, int * LEVEL)
     ERR: is a negative integer

     LEVEL: the alert level will be stored there

     Get an alert depending on the error code returned by a gnutls
     function.  All alerts sent by this function should be considered
     fatal.  The only exception is when 'err' is 'GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE'
     , where a warning alert should be sent to the peer indicating that
     no renegotiation will be performed.

     If there is no mapping to a valid alert the alert to indicate
     internal error ('GNUTLS_A_INTERNAL_ERROR' ) is returned.

     *Returns:* the alert code to use for a particular error code.

6.10 Priority strings
=====================

How to use Priority Strings
---------------------------

The GnuTLS priority strings specify the TLS session's handshake
algorithms and options in a compact, easy-to-use format.  These strings
are intended as a user-specified override of the library defaults.

That is, we recommend applications using the default settings (c.f.
*note gnutls_set_default_priority:: or *note
gnutls_set_default_priority_append::), and provide the user with access
to priority strings for overriding the default behavior, on
configuration files, or other UI. Following such a principle, makes the
GnuTLS library as the default settings provider.  That is necessary and
a good practice, because TLS protocol hardening and phasing out of
legacy algorithms, is easier to co-ordinate when happens in a single
library.

'INT *note gnutls_set_default_priority:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION)'
'INT *note gnutls_set_default_priority_append:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, const char * ADD_PRIO, const char ** ERR_POS, unsigned FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_priority_set_direct:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, const char * PRIORITIES, const char ** ERR_POS)'

The priority string translation to the internal GnuTLS form requires
processing and the generated internal form also occupies some memory.
For that, it is recommended to do that processing once in server side,
and share the generated data across sessions.  The following functions
allow the generation of a "priority cache" and the sharing of it across
sessions.

'INT *note gnutls_priority_init2:: (gnutls_priority_t * PRIORITY_CACHE, const char * PRIORITIES, const char ** ERR_POS, unsigned FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_priority_init:: (gnutls_priority_t * PRIORITY_CACHE, const char * PRIORITIES, const char ** ERR_POS)'
'INT *note gnutls_priority_set:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_priority_t PRIORITY)'
'VOID *note gnutls_priority_deinit:: (gnutls_priority_t PRIORITY_CACHE)'

Using Priority Strings
----------------------

A priority string string may contain a single initial keyword such as in
*note Table 6.3: tab:prio-keywords. and may be followed by additional
algorithm or special keywords.  Note that their description is
intentionally avoiding specific algorithm details, as the priority
strings are not constant between gnutls versions (they are periodically
updated to account for cryptographic advances while providing
compatibility with old clients and servers).

Keyword        Description
------------------------------------------------------------------
@KEYWORD       Means that a compile-time specified system
               configuration file (see
               *note System-wide configuration of the library::)
               will be used to expand the provided keyword.
               That is used to impose system-specific policies.
               It may be followed by additional options that
               will be appended to the system string (e.g.,
               "@SYSTEM:+SRP"). The system file should have the
               format 'KEYWORD=VALUE', e.g.,
               'SYSTEM=NORMAL:+ARCFOUR-128'.
               
               Since version 3.5.1 it is allowed to specify
               fallback keywords such as @KEYWORD1,@KEYWORD2,
               and the first valid keyword will be used.
               
PERFORMANCE    All the known to be secure ciphersuites are
               enabled, limited to 128 bit ciphers and sorted
               by terms of speed performance.  The message
               authenticity security level is of 64 bits or
               more, and the certificate verification profile
               is set to GNUTLS_PROFILE_LOW (80-bits).
               
NORMAL         Means all the known to be secure ciphersuites.
               The ciphers are sorted by security margin,
               although the 256-bit ciphers are included as a
               fallback only.  The message authenticity
               security level is of 64 bits or more, and the
               certificate verification profile is set to
               GNUTLS_PROFILE_LOW (80-bits).
               
               This priority string implicitly enables ECDHE
               and DHE. The ECDHE ciphersuites are placed first
               in the priority order, but due to compatibility
               issues with the DHE ciphersuites they are placed
               last in the priority order, after the plain RSA
               ciphersuites.
               
LEGACY         This sets the NORMAL settings that were used for
               GnuTLS 3.2.x or earlier.  There is no
               verification profile set, and the allowed DH
               primes are considered weak today (but are often
               used by misconfigured servers).
               
PFS            Means all the known to be secure ciphersuites
               that support perfect forward secrecy (ECDHE and
               DHE). The ciphers are sorted by security margin,
               although the 256-bit ciphers are included as a
               fallback only.  The message authenticity
               security level is of 80 bits or more, and the
               certificate verification profile is set to
               GNUTLS_PROFILE_LOW (80-bits).  This option is
               available since 3.2.4 or later.
               
SECURE128      Means all known to be secure ciphersuites that
               offer a security level 128-bit or more.  The
               message authenticity security level is of 80
               bits or more, and the certificate verification
               profile is set to GNUTLS_PROFILE_LOW (80-bits).
               
SECURE192      Means all the known to be secure ciphersuites
               that offer a security level 192-bit or more.
               The message authenticity security level is of
               128 bits or more, and the certificate
               verification profile is set to
               GNUTLS_PROFILE_HIGH (128-bits).
               
SECURE256      Currently alias for SECURE192.  This option,
               will enable ciphers which use a 256-bit key but,
               due to limitations of the TLS protocol, the
               overall security level will be 192-bits (the
               security level depends on more factors than
               cipher key size).
               
SUITEB128      Means all the NSA Suite B cryptography (RFC5430)
               ciphersuites with an 128 bit security level, as
               well as the enabling of the corresponding
               verification profile.
               
SUITEB192      Means all the NSA Suite B cryptography (RFC5430)
               ciphersuites with an 192 bit security level, as
               well as the enabling of the corresponding
               verification profile.
               
NONE           Means nothing is enabled.  This disables even
               protocol versions.  It should be followed by the
               algorithms to be enabled.  Note that using this
               option to build a priority string gives detailed
               control into the resulting settings, however
               with new revisions of the TLS protocol new
               priority items are routinely added, and such
               strings are not forward compatible with new
               protocols.  As such, we advice against using
               that option for applications targeting multiple
               versions of the GnuTLS library, and recommend
               using the defaults (see above) or adjusting the
               defaults via
               *note gnutls_set_default_priority_append::.
               

Table 6.3: Supported initial keywords.

Unless the initial keyword is "NONE" the defaults (in preference order)
are for TLS protocols TLS 1.2, TLS1.1, TLS1.0; for certificate types
X.509.  In key exchange algorithms when in NORMAL or SECURE levels the
perfect forward secrecy algorithms take precedence of the other
protocols.  In all cases all the supported key exchange algorithms are
enabled.

Note that the SECURE levels distinguish between overall security level
and message authenticity security level.  That is because the message
authenticity security level requires the adversary to break the
algorithms at real-time during the protocol run, whilst the overall
security level refers to off-line adversaries (e.g.  adversaries
breaking the ciphertext years after it was captured).

The NONE keyword, if used, must followed by keywords specifying the
algorithms and protocols to be enabled.  The other initial keywords do
not require, but may be followed by such keywords.  All level keywords
can be combined, and for example a level of "SECURE256:+SECURE128" is
allowed.

The order with which every algorithm or protocol is specified is
significant.  Algorithms specified before others will take precedence.
The supported in the GnuTLS version corresponding to this document
algorithms and protocols are shown in *note Table 6.4:
tab:prio-algorithms.; to list the supported algorithms in your currently
using version use 'gnutls-cli -l'.

To avoid collisions in order to specify a protocol version with "VERS-",
signature algorithms with "SIGN-" and certificate types with "CTYPE-".
All other algorithms don't need a prefix.  Each specified keyword
(except for _special keywords_) can be prefixed with any of the
following characters.

'!' or '-'
     appended with an algorithm will remove this algorithm.
"+"
     appended with an algorithm will add this algorithm.

               GROUP-FFDHE6144, and GROUP-FFDHE8192.  Groups
               include both elliptic curve groups, e.g.,
               SECP256R1, as well as finite field groups such
               as FFDHE2048.  Catch all which enables all
               groups from NORMAL priority is GROUP-ALL. The
               helper keywords GROUP-DH-ALL and GROUP-EC-ALL
               are also available, restricting the groups to
               finite fields (DH) and elliptic curves.

(legacy)       CURVE-SECP521R1, and CURVE-X25519.  Catch all
               which enables all curves from NORMAL priority is
               CURVE-ALL. Note that the CURVE keyword is kept
               for backwards compatibility only, for new
               applications see the GROUP keyword above.
               
Certificate    Certificate types can be given in a symmetric
types          fashion (i.e.  the same for both client and
               server) or, as of GnuTLS 3.6.4, in an asymmetric
               fashion (i.e.  different for the client than for
               the server).  Alternative certificate types must
               be explicitly enabled via flags in
               *note gnutls_init::.
               
               The currently supported types are CTYPE-X509,
               CTYPE-RAWPK which apply both to client and
               server; catch all is CTYPE-ALL. The types
               CTYPE-CLI-X509, CTYPE-SRV-X509, CTYPE-CLI-RAWPK,
               CTYPE-SRV-RAWPK can be used to specialize on
               client or server; catch all is CTYPE-CLI-ALL and
               CTYPE-SRV-ALL. The type 'X509' is aliased to
               'X.509' for legacy reasons.

%COMPAT                          will enable compatibility
                                 mode.  It might mean that
                                 violations of the protocols
                                 are allowed as long as maximum
                                 compatibility with problematic
                                 clients and servers is
                                 achieved.  More specifically
                                 this string will tolerate
                                 packets over the maximum
                                 allowed TLS record, and add a
                                 padding to TLS Client Hello
                                 packet to prevent it being in
                                 the 256-512 range which is
                                 known to be causing issues
                                 with a commonly used firewall
                                 (see the %DUMBFW option).
                                 
%DUMBFW                          will add a private extension
                                 with bogus data that make the
                                 client hello exceed 512 bytes.
                                 This avoids a black hole
                                 behavior in some firewalls.
                                 This is the [*note RFC7685::]
                                 client hello padding
                                 extension, also enabled with
                                 %COMPAT.
                                 
%NO_EXTENSIONS                   will prevent the sending of

                                 side.  Note that TLS 1.2
                                 requires extensions to be
                                 used, as well as safe
                                 renegotiation thus this option
                                 must be used with care.  When
                                 this option is set no versions
                                 later than TLS1.2 can be
                                 negotiated.
                                 
%NO_TICKETS                      will prevent the advertizing

                                 extension.  This is implied by
                                 the PFS keyword.
                                 
%NO_SESSION_HASH                 will prevent the advertizing

                                 (session hash) extension.
                                 
%SERVER_PRECEDENCE               The ciphersuite will be

                                 priorities and not the

                                 GnuTLS will set the minimum
                                 supported version as the
                                 client hello record version

                                 with the proposed handshake
                                 version at the client hello).
                                 
%LATEST_RECORD_VERSION           will use the latest TLS

                                 the client vulnerable to

                                 the default for clients and
                                 servers, for compatibility

6.11 Selecting cryptographic key sizes
======================================

Because many algorithms are involved in TLS, it is not easy to set a
consistent security level.  For this reason in *note Table 6.7:
tab:key-sizes. we present some correspondence between key sizes of
symmetric algorithms and public key algorithms based on [*note
ECRYPT::].  Those can be used to generate certificates with appropriate
key sizes as well as select parameters for Diffie-Hellman and SRP
authentication.

Table 6.7: Key sizes and security parameters.

The first column provides a security parameter in a number of bits.
This gives an indication of the number of combinations to be tried by an
adversary to brute force a key.  For example to test all possible keys
in a 112 bit security parameter 2^{112} combinations have to be tried.
For today's technology this is infeasible.  The next two columns
correlate the security parameter with actual bit sizes of parameters for
DH, RSA, SRP and ECC algorithms.  A mapping to 'gnutls_sec_param_t'
value is given for each security parameter, on the next column, and
finally a brief description of the level.

Note, however, that the values suggested here are nothing more than an
educated guess that is valid today.  There are no guarantees that an
algorithm will remain unbreakable or that these values will remain
constant in time.  There could be scientific breakthroughs that cannot
be predicted or total failure of the current public key systems by
quantum computers.  On the other hand though the cryptosystems used in
TLS are selected in a conservative way and such catastrophic
breakthroughs or failures are believed to be unlikely.  The NIST
publication SP 800-57 [*note NISTSP80057::] contains a similar table.

When using GnuTLS and a decision on bit sizes for a public key algorithm
is required, use of the following functions is recommended:

 -- Function: unsigned int gnutls_sec_param_to_pk_bits
          (gnutls_pk_algorithm_t ALGO, gnutls_sec_param_t PARAM)
     ALGO: is a public key algorithm

     PARAM: is a security parameter

     When generating private and public key pairs a difficult question
     is which size of "bits" the modulus will be in RSA and the group
     size in DSA. The easy answer is 1024, which is also wrong.  This
     function will convert a human understandable security parameter to
     an appropriate size for the specific algorithm.

     *Returns:* The number of bits, or (0).

     *Since:* 2.12.0

 -- Function: gnutls_sec_param_t gnutls_pk_bits_to_sec_param
          (gnutls_pk_algorithm_t ALGO, unsigned int BITS)
     ALGO: is a public key algorithm

     BITS: is the number of bits

     This is the inverse of 'gnutls_sec_param_to_pk_bits()' .  Given an
     algorithm and the number of bits, it will return the security
     parameter.  This is a rough indication.

     *Returns:* The security parameter.

     *Since:* 2.12.0

Those functions will convert a human understandable security parameter
of 'gnutls_sec_param_t' type, to a number of bits suitable for a public
key algorithm.

'CONST CHAR * *note gnutls_sec_param_get_name:: (gnutls_sec_param_t PARAM)'

The following functions will set the minimum acceptable group size for
Diffie-Hellman and SRP authentication.
'VOID *note gnutls_dh_set_prime_bits:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, unsigned int BITS)'
'VOID *note gnutls_srp_set_prime_bits:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, unsigned int BITS)'

6.12.1 Virtual hosts and credentials
------------------------------------

Often when operating with virtual hosts, one may not want to associate a
particular certificate set to the credentials function early, before the
virtual host is known.  That can be achieved by calling *note
gnutls_credentials_set:: within a handshake pre-hook for client hello.
That message contains the peer's intended hostname, and if read, and the
appropriate credentials are set, gnutls will be able to continue in the
handshake process.  A brief usage example is shown below.

     static int ext_hook_func(void *ctx, unsigned tls_id,
                              const unsigned char *data, unsigned size)
     {
     	if (tls_id == 0) { /* server name */
     		/* figure the advertized name - the following hack
                      * relies on the fact that this extension only supports
                      * DNS names, and due to a protocol bug cannot be extended
                      * to support anything else. */
     		if (name < 5) return 0;
     		name = data+5;
     		name_size = size-5;
     	}
     	return 0;
     }

     static int
     handshake_hook_func(gnutls_session_t session, unsigned int htype,
                         unsigned when, unsigned int incoming, const gnutls_datum_t *msg)
     {
         int ret;

         assert(htype == GNUTLS_HANDSHAKE_CLIENT_HELLO);
         assert(when == GNUTLS_HOOK_PRE);

         ret = gnutls_ext_raw_parse(NULL, ext_hook_func, msg,
                                    GNUTLS_EXT_RAW_FLAG_TLS_CLIENT_HELLO);
         assert(ret >= 0);

         gnutls_credentials_set(session, GNUTLS_CRD_CERTIFICATE, cred);

         return ret;
     }

     int main()
     {
       ...

       gnutls_handshake_set_hook_function(server, GNUTLS_HANDSHAKE_CLIENT_HELLO,
                                          GNUTLS_HOOK_PRE, handshake_hook_func);
       ...
     }

 -- Function: void gnutls_handshake_set_hook_function (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION, unsigned int HTYPE, int WHEN,
          gnutls_handshake_hook_func FUNC)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type

     HTYPE: the 'gnutls_handshake_description_t' of the message to hook
     at

     WHEN: 'GNUTLS_HOOK_' * depending on when the hook function should
     be called

     FUNC: is the function to be called

     This function will set a callback to be called after or before the
     specified handshake message has been received or generated.  This
     is a generalization of
     'gnutls_handshake_set_post_client_hello_function()' .

     To call the hook function prior to the message being generated or
     processed use 'GNUTLS_HOOK_PRE' as 'when' parameter,
     'GNUTLS_HOOK_POST' to call after, and 'GNUTLS_HOOK_BOTH' for both
     cases.

     This callback must return 0 on success or a gnutls error code to
     terminate the handshake.

     To hook at all handshake messages use an 'htype' of
     'GNUTLS_HANDSHAKE_ANY' .

     *Warning:* You should not use this function to terminate the
     handshake based on client input unless you know what you are doing.
     Before the handshake is finished there is no way to know if there
     is a man-in-the-middle attack being performed.

6.12.2 Session resumption
-------------------------

To reduce time and network traffic spent in a handshake the client can
request session resumption from a server that previously shared a
session with the client.

Under TLS 1.2, in order to support resumption a server can either store
the session security parameters in a local database or use session
tickets (see *note Session tickets::) to delegate storage to the client.

Under TLS 1.3, session resumption is only available through session
tickets, and multiple tickets could be sent from server to client.  That
provides the following advantages:
   * When tickets are not re-used the subsequent client sessions cannot
     be associated with each other by an eavesdropper
   * On post-handshake authentication the server may send different
     tickets asynchronously for each identity used by client.

Client side
...........

The client has to retrieve and store the session parameters.  Before
establishing a new session to the same server the parameters must be
re-associated with the GnuTLS session using *note
gnutls_session_set_data::.

'INT *note gnutls_session_get_data2:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_datum_t * DATA)'
'INT *note gnutls_session_set_data:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, const void * SESSION_DATA, size_t SESSION_DATA_SIZE)'

Keep in mind that sessions will be expired after some time, depending on
the server, and a server may choose not to resume a session even when
requested to.  The expiration is to prevent temporal session keys from
becoming long-term keys.  Also note that as a client you must enable,
using the priority functions, at least the algorithms used in the last
session.

 -- Function: int gnutls_session_is_resumed (gnutls_session_t SESSION)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     Checks whether session is resumed or not.  This is functional for
     both server and client side.

     *Returns:* non zero if this session is resumed, or a zero if this
     is a new session.

 -- Function: int gnutls_session_get_id2 (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          gnutls_datum_t * SESSION_ID)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     SESSION_ID: will point to the session ID.

     Returns the TLS session identifier.  The session ID is selected by
     the server, and in older versions of TLS was a unique identifier
     shared between client and server which was persistent across
     resumption.  In the latest version of TLS (1.3) or TLS 1.2 with
     session tickets, the notion of session identifiers is undefined and
     cannot be relied for uniquely identifying sessions across client
     and server.

     In client side this function returns the identifier returned by the
     server, and cannot be assumed to have any relation to session
     resumption.  In server side this function is guaranteed to return a
     persistent identifier of the session since GnuTLS 3.6.4, which may
     not necessarily map into the TLS session ID value.  Prior to that
     version the value could only be considered a persistent identifier,
     under TLS1.2 or earlier and when no session tickets were in use.

     The session identifier value returned is always less than
     'GNUTLS_MAX_SESSION_ID_SIZE' and should be treated as constant.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise an error code is returned.

     *Since:* 3.1.4

Server side
...........

A server enabling both session tickets and a storage for session data
would use session tickets when clients support it and the storage
otherwise.

A storing server needs to specify callback functions to store, retrieve
and delete session data.  These can be registered with the functions
below.  The stored sessions in the database can be checked using *note
gnutls_db_check_entry:: for expiration.

'VOID *note gnutls_db_set_retrieve_function:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_db_retr_func RETR_FUNC)'
'VOID *note gnutls_db_set_store_function:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_db_store_func STORE_FUNC)'
'VOID *note gnutls_db_set_ptr:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, void * PTR)'
'VOID *note gnutls_db_set_remove_function:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_db_remove_func REM_FUNC)'
'INT *note gnutls_db_check_entry:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_datum_t SESSION_ENTRY)'

A server supporting session tickets must generate ticket encryption and
authentication keys using *note gnutls_session_ticket_key_generate::.
Those keys should be associated with the GnuTLS session using *note
gnutls_session_ticket_enable_server::.

Those will be the initial keys, but GnuTLS will rotate them regularly.
The key rotation interval can be changed with *note
gnutls_db_set_cache_expiration:: and will be set to three times the
ticket expiration time (ie.  three times the value given in that
function).  Every such interval, new keys will be generated from those
initial keys.  This is a necessary mechanism to prevent the keys from
becoming long-term keys and as such preserve forward-secrecy in the
issued session tickets.  If no explicit key rotation interval is
provided, GnuTLS will rotate them every 18 hours by default.

The master key can be shared between processes or between systems.
Processes which share the same master key will generate the same rotated
subkeys, assuming they share the same time (irrespective of timezone
differences).

 -- Function: int gnutls_session_ticket_enable_server (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION, const gnutls_datum_t * KEY)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     KEY: key to encrypt session parameters.

     Request that the server should attempt session resumption using
     session tickets, i.e., by delegating storage to the client.  'key'
     must be initialized using 'gnutls_session_ticket_key_generate()' .
     To avoid leaking that key, use 'gnutls_memset()' prior to releasing
     it.

     The default ticket expiration time can be overridden using
     'gnutls_db_set_cache_expiration()' .

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned, or an
     error code.

     *Since:* 2.10.0

 -- Function: int gnutls_session_ticket_key_generate (gnutls_datum_t *
          KEY)
     KEY: is a pointer to a 'gnutls_datum_t' which will contain a newly
     created key.

     Generate a random key to encrypt security parameters within
     SessionTicket.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned, or an
     error code.

     *Since:* 2.10.0

 -- Function: int gnutls_session_resumption_requested (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     Check whether the client has asked for session resumption.  This
     function is valid only on server side.

     *Returns:* non zero if session resumption was asked, or a zero if
     not.

The expiration time for session resumption, either in tickets or stored
data is set using *note gnutls_db_set_cache_expiration::.  This function
also controls the ticket key rotation period.  Currently, the session
key rotation interval is set to 3 times the expiration time set by this
function.

Under TLS 1.3, the server sends by default 2 tickets, and can send
additional session tickets at any time using *note
gnutls_session_ticket_send::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_session_ticket_send (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          unsigned NR, unsigned FLAGS)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     NR: the number of tickets to send

     FLAGS: must be zero

     Sends a fresh session ticket to the peer.  This is relevant only in
     server side under TLS1.3.  This function may also return
     'GNUTLS_E_AGAIN' or 'GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED' and in that case it must
     be called again.

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' on success, or a negative error code.

6.12.3 Certificate verification
-------------------------------

In this section the functionality for additional certificate
verification methods is listed.  These methods are intended to be used
in addition to normal PKI verification, in order to reduce the risk of a
compromised CA being undetected.

6.12.3.1 Trust on first use
...........................

The GnuTLS library includes functionality to use an SSH-like trust on
first use authentication.  The available functions to store and verify
public keys are listed below.

 -- Function: int gnutls_verify_stored_pubkey (const char * DB_NAME,
          gnutls_tdb_t TDB, const char * HOST, const char * SERVICE,
          gnutls_certificate_type_t CERT_TYPE, const gnutls_datum_t *
          CERT, unsigned int FLAGS)
     DB_NAME: A file specifying the stored keys (use NULL for the
     default)

     TDB: A storage structure or NULL to use the default

     HOST: The peer's name

     SERVICE: non-NULL if this key is specific to a service (e.g.  http)

     CERT_TYPE: The type of the certificate

     CERT: The raw (der) data of the certificate

     FLAGS: should be 0.

     This function will try to verify a raw public-key or a public-key
     provided via a raw (DER-encoded) certificate using a list of stored
     public keys.  The 'service' field if non-NULL should be a port
     number.

     The 'db_name' variable if non-null specifies a custom backend for
     the retrieval of entries.  If it is NULL then the default file
     backend will be used.  In POSIX-like systems the file backend uses
     the $HOME/.gnutls/known_hosts file.

     Note that if the custom storage backend is provided the retrieval
     function should return 'GNUTLS_E_CERTIFICATE_KEY_MISMATCH' if the
     host/service pair is found but key doesn't match,
     'GNUTLS_E_NO_CERTIFICATE_FOUND' if no such host/service with the
     given key is found, and 0 if it was found.  The storage function
     should return 0 on success.

     As of GnuTLS 3.6.6 this function also verifies raw public keys.

     *Returns:* If no associated public key is found then
     'GNUTLS_E_NO_CERTIFICATE_FOUND' will be returned.  If a key is
     found but does not match 'GNUTLS_E_CERTIFICATE_KEY_MISMATCH' is
     returned.  On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned, or a
     negative error value on other errors.

     *Since:* 3.0.13

 -- Function: int gnutls_store_pubkey (const char * DB_NAME,
          gnutls_tdb_t TDB, const char * HOST, const char * SERVICE,
          gnutls_certificate_type_t CERT_TYPE, const gnutls_datum_t *
          CERT, time_t EXPIRATION, unsigned int FLAGS)
     DB_NAME: A file specifying the stored keys (use NULL for the
     default)

     TDB: A storage structure or NULL to use the default

     HOST: The peer's name

     SERVICE: non-NULL if this key is specific to a service (e.g.  http)

     CERT_TYPE: The type of the certificate

     CERT: The data of the certificate

     EXPIRATION: The expiration time (use 0 to disable expiration)

     FLAGS: should be 0.

     This function will store a raw public-key or a public-key provided
     via a raw (DER-encoded) certificate to the list of stored public
     keys.  The key will be considered valid until the provided
     expiration time.

     The 'tdb' variable if non-null specifies a custom backend for the
     storage of entries.  If it is NULL then the default file backend
     will be used.

     Unless an alternative 'tdb' is provided, the storage format is a
     textual format consisting of a line for each host with fields
     separated by '|'.  The contents of the fields are a
     format-identifier which is set to 'g0', the hostname that the rest
     of the data applies to, the numeric port or host name, the
     expiration time in seconds since the epoch (0 for no expiration),
     and a base64 encoding of the raw (DER) public key information
     (SPKI) of the peer.

     As of GnuTLS 3.6.6 this function also accepts raw public keys.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.0.13

In addition to the above the *note gnutls_store_commitment:: can be used
to implement a key-pinning architecture as in [*note KEYPIN::].  This
provides a way for web server to commit on a public key that is not yet
active.

 -- Function: int gnutls_store_commitment (const char * DB_NAME,
          gnutls_tdb_t TDB, const char * HOST, const char * SERVICE,
          gnutls_digest_algorithm_t HASH_ALGO, const gnutls_datum_t *
          HASH, time_t EXPIRATION, unsigned int FLAGS)
     DB_NAME: A file specifying the stored keys (use NULL for the
     default)

     TDB: A storage structure or NULL to use the default

     HOST: The peer's name

     SERVICE: non-NULL if this key is specific to a service (e.g.  http)

     HASH_ALGO: The hash algorithm type

     HASH: The raw hash

     EXPIRATION: The expiration time (use 0 to disable expiration)

     FLAGS: should be 0 or 'GNUTLS_SCOMMIT_FLAG_ALLOW_BROKEN' .

     This function will store the provided hash commitment to the list
     of stored public keys.  The key with the given hash will be
     considered valid until the provided expiration time.

     The 'tdb' variable if non-null specifies a custom backend for the
     storage of entries.  If it is NULL then the default file backend
     will be used.

     Note that this function is not thread safe with the default
     backend.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.0

The storage and verification functions may be used with the default text
file based back-end, or another back-end may be specified.  That should
contain storage and retrieval functions and specified as below.

'INT *note gnutls_tdb_init:: (gnutls_tdb_t * TDB)'
'VOID *note gnutls_tdb_deinit:: (gnutls_tdb_t TDB)'
'VOID *note gnutls_tdb_set_verify_func:: (gnutls_tdb_t TDB, gnutls_tdb_verify_func VERIFY)'
'VOID *note gnutls_tdb_set_store_func:: (gnutls_tdb_t TDB, gnutls_tdb_store_func STORE)'
'VOID *note gnutls_tdb_set_store_commitment_func:: (gnutls_tdb_t TDB, gnutls_tdb_store_commitment_func CSTORE)'

6.12.3.2 DANE verification
..........................

Since the DANE library is not included in GnuTLS it requires programs to
be linked against it.  This can be achieved with the following commands.

     gcc -o foo foo.c `pkg-config gnutls-dane --cflags --libs`

When a program uses the GNU autoconf system, then the following line or
similar can be used to detect the presence of the library.

     PKG_CHECK_MODULES([LIBDANE], [gnutls-dane >= 3.0.0])

     AC_SUBST([LIBDANE_CFLAGS])
     AC_SUBST([LIBDANE_LIBS])

The high level functionality provided by the DANE library is shown
below.

 -- Function: int dane_verify_crt (dane_state_t S, const gnutls_datum_t
          * CHAIN, unsigned CHAIN_SIZE, gnutls_certificate_type_t
          CHAIN_TYPE, const char * HOSTNAME, const char * PROTO,
          unsigned int PORT, unsigned int SFLAGS, unsigned int VFLAGS,
          unsigned int * VERIFY)
     S: A DANE state structure (may be NULL)

     CHAIN: A certificate chain

     CHAIN_SIZE: The size of the chain

     CHAIN_TYPE: The type of the certificate chain

     HOSTNAME: The hostname associated with the chain

     PROTO: The protocol of the service connecting (e.g.  tcp)

     PORT: The port of the service connecting (e.g.  443)

     SFLAGS: Flags for the initialization of 's' (if NULL)

     VFLAGS: Verification flags; an OR'ed list of 'dane_verify_flags_t'
     .

     VERIFY: An OR'ed list of 'dane_verify_status_t' .

     This function will verify the given certificate chain against the
     CA constrains and/or the certificate available via DANE. If no
     information via DANE can be obtained the flag
     'DANE_VERIFY_NO_DANE_INFO' is set.  If a DNSSEC signature is not
     available for the DANE record then the verify flag
     'DANE_VERIFY_NO_DNSSEC_DATA' is set.

     Due to the many possible options of DANE, there is no single threat
     model countered.  When notifying the user about DANE verification
     results it may be better to mention: DANE verification did not
     reject the certificate, rather than mentioning a successful DANE
     verication.

     Note that this function is designed to be run in addition to PKIX -
     certificate chain - verification.  To be run independently the
     'DANE_VFLAG_ONLY_CHECK_EE_USAGE' flag should be specified; then the
     function will check whether the key of the peer matches the key
     advertized in the DANE entry.

     *Returns:* a negative error code on error and 'DANE_E_SUCCESS' (0)
     when the DANE entries were successfully parsed, irrespective of
     whether they were verified (see 'verify' for that information).  If
     no usable entries were encountered
     'DANE_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE' will be returned.

'INT *note dane_verify_session_crt:: (dane_state_t S, gnutls_session_t SESSION, const char * HOSTNAME, const char * PROTO, unsigned int PORT, unsigned int SFLAGS, unsigned int VFLAGS, unsigned int * VERIFY)'
'CONST CHAR * *note dane_strerror:: (int ERROR)'

Note that the 'dane_state_t' structure that is accepted by both
verification functions is optional.  It is required when many queries
are performed to optimize against multiple re-initializations of the
resolving back-end and loading of DNSSEC keys.

The following flags are returned by the verify functions to indicate the
status of the verification.

'DANE_VERIFY_CA_CONSTRAINTS_VIOLATED'
     The CA constraints were violated.
'DANE_VERIFY_CERT_DIFFERS'
     The certificate obtained via DNS differs.
'DANE_VERIFY_UNKNOWN_DANE_INFO'
     No known DANE data was found in the DNS record.

Figure 6.3: The DANE verification status flags.

In order to generate a DANE TLSA entry to use in a DNS server you may
use danetool (see *note danetool Invocation::).


File: gnutls.info,  Node: TLS 1.2 re-authentication,  Next: TLS 1.3 re-authentication and re-key,  Prev: Certificate verification,  Up: Advanced topics

6.12.4 TLS 1.2 re-authentication
--------------------------------

In TLS 1.2 or earlier there is no distinction between re-key,
re-authentication, and re-negotiation.  All of these use cases are
handled by the TLS' rehandshake process.  For that reason in GnuTLS
rehandshake is not transparent to the application, and the application
must explicitly take control of that process.  In addition GnuTLS since
version 3.5.0 will not allow the peer to switch identities during a
rehandshake.  The threat addressed by that behavior depends on the
application protocol, but primarily it protects applications from being
misled by a rehandshake which switches the peer's identity.
Applications can disable this protection by using the
'GNUTLS_ALLOW_ID_CHANGE' flag in *note gnutls_init::.

The following paragraphs explain how to safely use the rehandshake
process.

6.12.4.1 Client side
....................

According to the TLS specification a client may initiate a rehandshake
at any time.  That can be achieved by calling *note gnutls_handshake::
and rely on its return value for the outcome of the handshake (the
server may deny a rehandshake).  If a server requests a re-handshake,
then a call to *note gnutls_record_recv:: will return
GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE in the client, instructing it to call *note
gnutls_handshake::.  To deny a rehandshake request by the server it is
recommended to send a warning alert of type GNUTLS_A_NO_RENEGOTIATION.

Due to limitations of early protocol versions, it is required to check
whether safe renegotiation is in place, i.e., using *note
gnutls_safe_renegotiation_status::, which ensures that the server
remains the same as the initial.

To make re-authentication transparent to the application when requested
by the server, use the 'GNUTLS_AUTO_REAUTH' flag on the *note
gnutls_init:: call.  In that case the re-authentication will happen in
the call of *note gnutls_record_recv:: that received the
reauthentication request.

 -- Function: unsigned gnutls_safe_renegotiation_status
          (gnutls_session_t SESSION)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     Can be used to check whether safe renegotiation is being used in
     the current session.

     *Returns:* 0 when safe renegotiation is not used and non (0) when
     safe renegotiation is used.

     *Since:* 2.10.0

6.12.4.2 Server side
....................

A server which wants to instruct the client to re-authenticate, should
call *note gnutls_rehandshake:: and wait for the client to
re-authenticate.  It is recommended to only request re-handshake when
safe renegotiation is enabled for that session (see *note
gnutls_safe_renegotiation_status:: and the discussion in *note Safe
renegotiation::).  A server could also encounter the
GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE error code while receiving data.  That indicates a
client-initiated re-handshake request.  In that case the server could
ignore that request, perform handshake (unsafe when done generally), or
even drop the connection.

 -- Function: int gnutls_rehandshake (gnutls_session_t SESSION)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     This function can only be called in server side, and instructs a
     TLS 1.2 or earlier client to renegotiate parameters (perform a
     handshake), by sending a hello request message.

     If this function succeeds, the calling application should call
     'gnutls_record_recv()' until 'GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE' is returned to
     clear any pending data.  If the 'GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE' error code
     is not seen, then the handshake request was not followed by the
     peer (the TLS protocol does not require the client to do, and such
     compliance should be handled by the application protocol).

     Once the 'GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE' error code is seen, the calling
     application should proceed to calling 'gnutls_handshake()' to
     negotiate the new parameters.

     If the client does not wish to renegotiate parameters he may reply
     with an alert message, and in that case the return code seen by
     subsequent 'gnutls_record_recv()' will be
     'GNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED' with the specific alert being
     'GNUTLS_A_NO_RENEGOTIATION' .  A client may also choose to ignore
     this request.

     Under TLS 1.3 this function is equivalent to
     'gnutls_session_key_update()' with the 'GNUTLS_KU_PEER' flag.  In
     that case subsequent calls to 'gnutls_record_recv()' will not
     return 'GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE' , and calls to 'gnutls_handshake()'
     in server side are a no-op.

     This function always fails with 'GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST' when
     called in client side.

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' on success, otherwise a negative
     error code.

6.12.5 TLS 1.3 re-authentication and re-key
-------------------------------------------

The TLS 1.3 protocol distinguishes between re-key and re-authentication.
The re-key process ensures that fresh keys are supplied to the already
negotiated parameters, and on GnuTLS can be initiated using *note
gnutls_session_key_update::.  The re-key process can be one-way (i.e.,
the calling party only changes its keys), or two-way where the peer is
requested to change keys as well.

The re-authentication process, allows the connected client to switch
identity by presenting a new certificate.  Unlike TLS 1.2, the server is
not allowed to change identities.  That client re-authentication, or
post-handshake authentication can be initiated only by the server using
*note gnutls_reauth::, and only if a client has advertized support for
it.  Both server and client have to explicitly enable support for post
handshake authentication using the 'GNUTLS_POST_HANDSHAKE_AUTH' flag at
*note gnutls_init::.

A client receiving a re-authentication request will "see" the error code
'GNUTLS_E_REAUTH_REQUEST' at *note gnutls_record_recv::.  At this point,
it should also call *note gnutls_reauth::.

To make re-authentication transparent to the application when requested
by the server, use the 'GNUTLS_AUTO_REAUTH' and
'GNUTLS_POST_HANDSHAKE_AUTH' flags on the *note gnutls_init:: call.  In
that case the re-authentication will happen in the call of *note
gnutls_record_recv:: that received the reauthentication request.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Parameter generation,  Next: Deriving keys for other applications/protocols,  Prev: TLS 1.3 re-authentication and re-key,  Up: Advanced topics

6.12.6 Parameter generation
---------------------------

Prior to GnuTLS 3.6.0 for the ephemeral or anonymous Diffie-Hellman (DH)
TLS ciphersuites the application was required to generate or provide DH
parameters.  That is no longer necessary as GnuTLS utilizes DH
parameters and negotiation from [*note RFC7919::].

Applications can tune the used parameters by explicitly specifying them
in the priority string.  In server side applications can set the minimum
acceptable level of DH parameters by calling *note
gnutls_certificate_set_known_dh_params::, *note
gnutls_anon_set_server_known_dh_params::, or *note
gnutls_psk_set_server_known_dh_params::, depending on the type of the
credentials, to set the lower acceptable parameter limits.  Typical
applications should rely on the default settings.

'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_known_dh_params:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, gnutls_sec_param_t SEC_PARAM)'
'INT *note gnutls_anon_set_server_known_dh_params:: (gnutls_anon_server_credentials_t RES, gnutls_sec_param_t SEC_PARAM)'
'INT *note gnutls_psk_set_server_known_dh_params:: (gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t RES, gnutls_sec_param_t SEC_PARAM)'

6.12.6.1 Legacy parameter generation
....................................

Note that older than 3.5.6 versions of GnuTLS provided functions to
generate or import arbitrary DH parameters from a file.  This practice
is still supported but discouraged in current versions.  There is no
known advantage from using random parameters, while there have been
several occasions where applications were utilizing incorrect, weak or
insecure parameters.  This is the main reason GnuTLS includes the
well-known parameters of [*note RFC7919::] and recommends applications
utilizing them.

In older applications which require to specify explicit DH parameters,
we recommend using 'certtool' (of GnuTLS 3.5.6 or later) with the
'--get-dh-params' option to obtain the FFDHE parameters discussed above.
The output parameters of the tool are in PKCS#3 format and can be
imported by most existing applications.

The following functions are still supported but considered obsolete.

'INT *note gnutls_dh_params_generate2:: (gnutls_dh_params_t DPARAMS, unsigned int BITS)'
'INT *note gnutls_dh_params_import_pkcs3:: (gnutls_dh_params_t PARAMS, const gnutls_datum_t * PKCS3_PARAMS, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT)'
'VOID *note gnutls_certificate_set_dh_params:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, gnutls_dh_params_t DH_PARAMS)'

6.12.7 Deriving keys for other applications/protocols
-----------------------------------------------------

In several cases, after a TLS connection is established, it is desirable
to derive keys to be used in another application or protocol (e.g., in
an other TLS session using pre-shared keys).  The following describe
GnuTLS' implementation of RFC5705 to extract keys based on a session's
master secret.

The API to use is *note gnutls_prf_rfc5705::.  The function needs to be
provided with a label, and additional context data to mix in the
'context' parameter.

 -- Function: int gnutls_prf_rfc5705 (gnutls_session_t SESSION, size_t
          LABEL_SIZE, const char * LABEL, size_t CONTEXT_SIZE, const
          char * CONTEXT, size_t OUTSIZE, char * OUT)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     LABEL_SIZE: length of the 'label' variable.

     LABEL: label used in PRF computation, typically a short string.

     CONTEXT_SIZE: length of the 'extra' variable.

     CONTEXT: optional extra data to seed the PRF with.

     OUTSIZE: size of pre-allocated output buffer to hold the output.

     OUT: pre-allocated buffer to hold the generated data.

     Exports keying material from TLS/DTLS session to an application, as
     specified in RFC5705.

     In the TLS versions prior to 1.3, it applies the TLS
     Pseudo-Random-Function (PRF) on the master secret and the provided
     data, seeded with the client and server random fields.

     In TLS 1.3, it applies HKDF on the exporter master secret derived
     from the master secret.

     The 'label' variable usually contains a string denoting the purpose
     for the generated data.

     The 'context' variable can be used to add more data to the seed,
     after the random variables.  It can be used to make sure the
     generated output is strongly connected to some additional data
     (e.g., a string used in user authentication).

     The output is placed in 'out' , which must be pre-allocated.

     Note that, to provide the RFC5705 context, the 'context' variable
     must be non-null.

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' on success, or an error code.

     *Since:* 3.4.4

For example, after establishing a TLS session using *note
gnutls_handshake::, you can obtain 32-bytes to be used as key, using
this call:

     #define MYLABEL "EXPORTER-My-protocol-name"
     #define MYCONTEXT "my-protocol's-1st-session"

     char out[32];
     rc = gnutls_prf_rfc5705 (session, sizeof(MYLABEL)-1, MYLABEL,
                              sizeof(MYCONTEXT)-1, MYCONTEXT, 32, out);

The output key depends on TLS' master secret, and is the same on both
client and server.

For legacy applications which need to use a more flexible API, there is
*note gnutls_prf::, which in addition, allows to switch the mix of the
client and server random nonces, using the 'server_random_first'

TLS1.2 PRF, there is a low-level TLS PRF interface called *note
gnutls_prf_raw::.  That however is not functional under newer protocol
versions.

6.12.8 Channel bindings
-----------------------

In user authentication protocols (e.g., EAP or SASL mechanisms) it is
useful to have a unique string that identifies the secure channel that
is used, to bind together the user authentication with the secure
channel.  This can protect against man-in-the-middle attacks in some
situations.  That unique string is called a "channel binding".  For
background and discussion see [*note RFC5056::].

In GnuTLS you can extract a channel binding using the *note
gnutls_session_channel_binding:: function.  Currently only the type
'GNUTLS_CB_TLS_UNIQUE' is supported, which corresponds to the
'tls-unique' channel binding for TLS defined in [*note RFC5929::].

The following example describes how to print the channel binding data.
Note that it must be run after a successful TLS handshake.

     {
       gnutls_datum_t cb;
       int rc;

       rc = gnutls_session_channel_binding (session,
                                            GNUTLS_CB_TLS_UNIQUE,
                                            &cb);
       if (rc)
         fprintf (stderr, "Channel binding error: %s\n",
                  gnutls_strerror (rc));
       else
         {
           size_t i;
           printf ("- Channel binding 'tls-unique': ");
           for (i = 0; i < cb.size; i++)
             printf ("%02x", cb.data[i]);
           printf ("\n");
         }
     }

6.12.9 Interoperability
-----------------------

The TLS protocols support many ciphersuites, extensions and version
numbers.  As a result, few implementations are not able to properly
interoperate once faced with extensions or version protocols they do not
support and understand.  The TLS protocol allows for a graceful
downgrade to the commonly supported options, but practice shows it is
not always implemented correctly.

Because there is no way to achieve maximum interoperability with broken
peers without sacrificing security, GnuTLS ignores such peers by
default.  This might not be acceptable in cases where maximum
compatibility is required.  Thus we allow enabling compatibility with
broken peers using priority strings (see *note Priority Strings::).  A
conservative priority string that would disable certain TLS protocol
options that are known to cause compatibility problems, is shown below.
NORMAL:%COMPAT

For very old broken peers that do not tolerate TLS version numbers over
TLS 1.0 another priority string is:
NORMAL:-VERS-ALL:+VERS-TLS1.0:+VERS-SSL3.0:%COMPAT
This priority string will in addition to above, only enable SSL 3.0 and
TLS 1.0 as protocols.

6.12.10 Compatibility with the OpenSSL library
----------------------------------------------

To ease GnuTLS' integration with existing applications, a compatibility
layer with the OpenSSL library is included in the 'gnutls-openssl'
library.  This compatibility layer is not complete and it is not
intended to completely re-implement the OpenSSL API with GnuTLS.  It
only provides limited source-level compatibility.

The prototypes for the compatibility functions are in the
'gnutls/openssl.h' header file.  The limitations imposed by the
compatibility layer include:

   * Error handling is not thread safe.

7.1.1 Client example with X.509 certificate support
---------------------------------------------------

Let's assume now that we want to create a TCP client which communicates
with servers that use X.509 certificate authentication.  The following
client is a very simple TLS client, which uses the high level
verification functions for certificates, but does not support session
resumption.

Note that this client utilizes functionality present in the latest
GnuTLS version.  For a reasonably portable version see *note Legacy
client example with X.509 certificate support::.

7.3.1 Client example with anonymous authentication
--------------------------------------------------

The simplest client using TLS is the one that doesn't do any
authentication.  This means no external certificates or passwords are
needed to set up the connection.  As could be expected, the connection
is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (active or redirection) attacks.
However, the data are integrity protected and encrypted from passive
eavesdroppers.

Note that due to the vulnerable nature of this method very few public
servers support it.

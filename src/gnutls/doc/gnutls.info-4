E.2 Datagram TLS API
====================

The prototypes for the following functions lie in 'gnutls/dtls.h'.

gnutls_dtls_cookie_send
-----------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_dtls_cookie_send (gnutls_datum_t * KEY, void *
          CLIENT_DATA, size_t CLIENT_DATA_SIZE, gnutls_dtls_prestate_st
          * PRESTATE, gnutls_transport_ptr_t PTR, gnutls_push_func
          PUSH_FUNC)
     KEY: is a random key to be used at cookie generation

     CLIENT_DATA: contains data identifying the client (i.e.  address)

     CLIENT_DATA_SIZE: The size of client's data

     PRESTATE: The previous cookie returned by
     'gnutls_dtls_cookie_verify()'

     PTR: A transport pointer to be used by 'push_func'

     PUSH_FUNC: A function that will be used to reply

     This function can be used to prevent denial of service attacks to a
     DTLS server by requiring the client to reply using a cookie sent by
     this function.  That way it can be ensured that a client we
     allocated resources for (i.e.  'gnutls_session_t' ) is the one that
     the original incoming packet was originated from.

     This function must be called at the first incoming packet, prior to
     allocating any resources and must be succeeded by
     'gnutls_dtls_cookie_verify()' .

     *Returns:* the number of bytes sent, or a negative error code.

     *Since:* 3.0

gnutls_dtls_cookie_verify
-------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_dtls_cookie_verify (gnutls_datum_t * KEY, void
          * CLIENT_DATA, size_t CLIENT_DATA_SIZE, void * _MSG, size_t
          MSG_SIZE, gnutls_dtls_prestate_st * PRESTATE)
     KEY: is a random key to be used at cookie generation

     CLIENT_DATA: contains data identifying the client (i.e.  address)

     CLIENT_DATA_SIZE: The size of client's data

     _MSG: An incoming message that initiates a connection.

     MSG_SIZE: The size of the message.

     PRESTATE: The cookie of this client.

     This function will verify the received message for a valid cookie.
     If a valid cookie is returned then it should be associated with the
     session using 'gnutls_dtls_prestate_set()' ;

     This function must be called after 'gnutls_dtls_cookie_send()' .

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) on success, or a negative error
     code.

     *Since:* 3.0

gnutls_dtls_get_data_mtu
------------------------

 -- Function: unsigned int gnutls_dtls_get_data_mtu (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     This function will return the actual maximum transfer unit for
     application data.  I.e.  DTLS headers are subtracted from the
     actual MTU which is set using 'gnutls_dtls_set_mtu()' .

     *Returns:* the maximum allowed transfer unit.

     *Since:* 3.0

gnutls_dtls_get_mtu
-------------------

 -- Function: unsigned int gnutls_dtls_get_mtu (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     This function will return the MTU size as set with
     'gnutls_dtls_set_mtu()' .  This is not the actual MTU of data you
     can transmit.  Use 'gnutls_dtls_get_data_mtu()' for that reason.

     *Returns:* the set maximum transfer unit.

     *Since:* 3.0

gnutls_dtls_get_timeout
-----------------------

 -- Function: unsigned int gnutls_dtls_get_timeout (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     This function will return the milliseconds remaining for a
     retransmission of the previously sent handshake message.  This
     function is useful when DTLS is used in non-blocking mode, to
     estimate when to call 'gnutls_handshake()' if no packets have been
     received.

     *Returns:* the remaining time in milliseconds.

     *Since:* 3.0

gnutls_dtls_prestate_set
------------------------

 -- Function: void gnutls_dtls_prestate_set (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          gnutls_dtls_prestate_st * PRESTATE)
     SESSION: a new session

     PRESTATE: contains the client's prestate

     This function will associate the prestate acquired by the cookie
     authentication with the client, with the newly established session.

     This functions must be called after a successful
     'gnutls_dtls_cookie_verify()' and should be succeeded by the actual
     DTLS handshake using 'gnutls_handshake()' .

     *Since:* 3.0

gnutls_dtls_set_data_mtu
------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_dtls_set_data_mtu (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          unsigned int MTU)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     MTU: The maximum unencrypted transfer unit of the session

     This function will set the maximum size of the *unencrypted*
     records which will be sent over a DTLS session.  It is equivalent
     to calculating the DTLS packet overhead with the current encryption
     parameters, and calling 'gnutls_dtls_set_mtu()' with that value.
     In particular, this means that you may need to call this function
     again after any negotiation or renegotiation, in order to ensure
     that the MTU is still sufficient to account for the new protocol
     overhead.

     In most cases you only need to call 'gnutls_dtls_set_mtu()' with
     the maximum MTU of your transport layer.

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) on success, or a negative error
     code.

     *Since:* 3.1

gnutls_dtls_set_mtu
-------------------

 -- Function: void gnutls_dtls_set_mtu (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          unsigned int MTU)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     MTU: The maximum transfer unit of the transport

     This function will set the maximum transfer unit of the transport
     that DTLS packets are sent over.  Note that this should exclude the
     IP (or IPv6) and UDP headers.  So for DTLS over IPv6 on an Ethernet
     device with MTU 1500, the DTLS MTU set with this function would be
     1500 - 40 (IPV6 header) - 8 (UDP header) = 1452.

     *Since:* 3.0

gnutls_dtls_set_timeouts
------------------------

 -- Function: void gnutls_dtls_set_timeouts (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          unsigned int RETRANS_TIMEOUT, unsigned int TOTAL_TIMEOUT)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     RETRANS_TIMEOUT: The time at which a retransmission will occur in
     milliseconds

     TOTAL_TIMEOUT: The time at which the connection will be aborted, in
     milliseconds.

     This function will set the timeouts required for the DTLS handshake
     protocol.  The retransmission timeout is the time after which a
     message from the peer is not received, the previous messages will
     be retransmitted.  The total timeout is the time after which the
     handshake will be aborted with 'GNUTLS_E_TIMEDOUT' .

     The DTLS protocol recommends the values of 1 sec and 60 seconds
     respectively, and these are the default values.

     To disable retransmissions set a 'retrans_timeout' larger than the
     'total_timeout' .

     *Since:* 3.0

gnutls_record_get_discarded
---------------------------

 -- Function: unsigned int gnutls_record_get_discarded (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' type.

     Returns the number of discarded packets in a DTLS connection.

     *Returns:* The number of discarded packets.

     *Since:* 3.0

     RES: is a 'gnutls_certificate_credentials_t' type.

     TLIST: Location where to store the trust list.

     Obtains the list of trusted certificates stored in 'res' and writes
     a pointer to it to the location 'tlist' .  The pointer will point
     to memory internal to 'res' , and must not be deinitialized.  It
     will be automatically deallocated when the 'res' structure is
     deinitialized.

     *Since:* 3.4.0

gnutls_certificate_set_trust_list
---------------------------------

 -- Function: void gnutls_certificate_set_trust_list

     RES: is a 'gnutls_certificate_credentials_t' type.

     TLIST: is a 'gnutls_x509_trust_list_t' type

     FLAGS: must be zero

     This function sets a trust list in the
     gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type.

     Note that the 'tlist' will become part of the credentials structure
     and must not be deallocated.  It will be automatically deallocated
     when the 'res' structure is deinitialized.

     OID: if non-NULL it will contain an allocated null-terminated
     variable with the OID

     This function will provide information on the algorithms used in a
     particular PKCS '8' structure.  If the structure algorithms are
     unknown the code 'GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_CIPHER_TYPE' will be returned,
     and only 'oid' , will be set.  That is, 'oid' will be set on
     encrypted PKCS '8' structures whether supported or not.  It must be
     deinitialized using 'gnutls_free()' .  The other variables are only
     set on supported structures.

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST' if the provided structure
     isn't an encrypted key, 'GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_CIPHER_TYPE' if the
     structure's encryption isn't supported, or another negative error
     code in case of a failure.  Zero on success.

     *Since:* 3.4.0

     keeps state in the iterator between calls.  That allows it to
     provide better performance in sequences with many elements
     (50000+).

     When past the last element is accessed
     'GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE' is returned and the

     3.1.4 this function includes the time checks.

     Note that value in 'verify' is set only when the return value of
     this function is success (i.e, failure to trust a CRL a certificate
     does not imply a negative return value).

     Before GnuTLS 3.5.7 this function would return zero or a positive
     number on success.

          (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT)
     CERT: should contain a 'gnutls_x509_crt_t' type

     This function will return the time this Certificate was or will be
     activated.

     *Returns:* activation time, or (time_t)-1 on error.

gnutls_x509_crt_get_authority_info_access
-----------------------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crt_get_authority_info_access
          (gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT, unsigned int SEQ, int WHAT,
          gnutls_datum_t * DATA, unsigned int * CRITICAL)
     CRT: Holds the certificate

     SEQ: specifies the sequence number of the access descriptor (0 for
     the first one, 1 for the second etc.)

     WHAT: what data to get, a 'gnutls_info_access_what_t' type.

     DATA: output data to be freed with 'gnutls_free()' .

     CRITICAL: pointer to output integer that is set to non-zero if the
     extension is marked as critical (may be 'NULL' )

     Note that a simpler API to access the authority info data is
     provided by 'gnutls_x509_aia_get()' and
     'gnutls_x509_ext_import_aia()' .

     This function extracts the Authority Information Access (AIA)
     extension, see RFC 5280 section 4.2.2.1 for more information.  The
     AIA extension holds a sequence of AccessDescription (AD) data.

     The 'seq' input parameter is used to indicate which member of the
     sequence the caller is interested in.  The first member is 0, the
     second member 1 and so on.  When the 'seq' value is out of bounds,
     'GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE' is returned.

     The type of data returned in 'data' is specified via 'what' which
     should be 'gnutls_info_access_what_t' values.

     If 'what' is 'GNUTLS_IA_ACCESSMETHOD_OID' then 'data' will hold the
     accessMethod OID (e.g., "1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1").

     If 'what' is 'GNUTLS_IA_ACCESSLOCATION_GENERALNAME_TYPE' , 'data'
     will hold the accessLocation GeneralName type (e.g.,
     "uniformResourceIdentifier").

     If 'what' is 'GNUTLS_IA_URI' , 'data' will hold the accessLocation
     URI data.  Requesting this 'what' value leads to an error if the
     accessLocation is not of the "uniformResourceIdentifier" type.

     If 'what' is 'GNUTLS_IA_OCSP_URI' , 'data' will hold the OCSP URI.
     Requesting this 'what' value leads to an error if the accessMethod
     is not 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1 aka OCSP, or if accessLocation is not of
     the "uniformResourceIdentifier" type.  In that case
     'GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_ALGORITHM' will be returned, and 'seq' should be
     increased and this function called again.

     If 'what' is 'GNUTLS_IA_CAISSUERS_URI' , 'data' will hold the
     caIssuers URI. Requesting this 'what' value leads to an error if
     the accessMethod is not 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2 aka caIssuers, or if
     accessLocation is not of the "uniformResourceIdentifier" type.  In
     that case handle as in 'GNUTLS_IA_OCSP_URI' .

     More 'what' values may be allocated in the future as needed.

     If 'data' is NULL, the function does the same without storing the
     output data, that is, it will set 'critical' and do error checking
     as usual.

     The value of the critical flag is returned in * 'critical' .
     Supply a NULL 'critical' if you want the function to make sure the
     extension is non-critical, as required by RFC 5280.

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' on success,
     'GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST' on invalid 'crt' ,
     'GNUTLS_E_CONSTRAINT_ERROR' if the extension is incorrectly marked
     as critical (use a non-NULL 'critical' to override),
     'GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_ALGORITHM' if the requested OID does not match
     (e.g., when using 'GNUTLS_IA_OCSP_URI' ), otherwise a negative
     error code.

     *Since:* 3.0

     SERIAL_SIZE: Holds the size of the serial field (may be null)

     CRITICAL: will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical
     (may be null)

     This function will return the X.509 authority key identifier when
     stored as a general name (authorityCertIssuer) and serial number.

     Because more than one general names might be stored 'seq' can be
     used as a counter to request them all until
     'GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE' is returned.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     'GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE' if the extension is not
     present, otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.0

     ID: The place where the identifier will be copied

     ID_SIZE: Holds the size of the id field.

     CRITICAL: will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical
     (may be null)

     This function will return the X.509v3 certificate authority's key
     identifier.  This is obtained by the X.509 Authority Key identifier
     extension field (2.5.29.35).  Note that this function only returns
     the keyIdentifier field of the extension and
     'GNUTLS_E_X509_UNSUPPORTED_EXTENSION' , if the extension contains
     the name and serial number of the certificate.  In that case
     'gnutls_x509_crt_get_authority_key_gn_serial()' may be used.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     'GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE' if the extension is not
     present, otherwise a negative error value.

     CERT: should contain a 'gnutls_x509_crt_t' type

     CRITICAL: will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical

     CA: pointer to output integer indicating CA status, may be NULL,
     value is 1 if the certificate CA flag is set, 0 otherwise.

     PATHLEN: pointer to output integer indicating path length (may be
     NULL), non-negative error codes indicate a present
     pathLenConstraint field and the actual value, -1 indicate that the
     field is absent.

     This function will read the certificate's basic constraints, and
     return the certificates CA status.  It reads the basicConstraints
     X.509 extension (2.5.29.19).

     *Returns:* If the certificate is a CA a positive value will be
     returned, or (0) if the certificate does not have CA flag set.  A
     negative error code may be returned in case of errors.  If the
     certificate does not contain the basicConstraints extension
     GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE will be returned.

     CRITICAL: will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical

     This function will return certificates CA status, by reading the
     basicConstraints X.509 extension (2.5.29.19).  If the certificate
     is a CA a positive value will be returned, or (0) if the
     certificate does not have CA flag set.

     Use 'gnutls_x509_crt_get_basic_constraints()' if you want to read
     the pathLenConstraint field too.

     *Returns:* If the certificate is a CA a positive value will be
     returned, or (0) if the certificate does not have CA flag set.  A
     negative error code may be returned in case of errors.  If the
     certificate does not contain the basicConstraints extension
     GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE will be returned.

     certificate.  The extension OID will be stored as a string in the
     provided buffer.

     The 'oid' returned will be null terminated, although 'oid_size'
     will not account for the trailing null.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error code is returned.  If you have reached
     the last extension available
     'GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE' will be returned.

gnutls_x509_crt_get_fingerprint
-------------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crt_get_fingerprint (gnutls_x509_crt_t
          CERT, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t ALGO, void * BUF, size_t *
          BUF_SIZE)
     CERT: should contain a 'gnutls_x509_crt_t' type

     ALGO: is a digest algorithm

     BUF: a pointer to a structure to hold the fingerprint (may be null)

     BUF_SIZE: initially holds the size of 'buf'

     This function will calculate and copy the certificate's fingerprint
     in the provided buffer.  The fingerprint is a hash of the
     DER-encoded data of the certificate.

     If the buffer is null then only the size will be filled.

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER' if the provided buffer is
     not long enough, and in that case the *buf_size will be updated
     with the required size.  On success 0 is returned.

gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer
--------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT,
          gnutls_x509_dn_t * DN)
     CERT: should contain a 'gnutls_x509_crt_t' type

     DN: output variable with pointer to uint8_t DN

     Return the Certificate's Issuer DN as a 'gnutls_x509_dn_t' data
     type, that can be decoded using 'gnutls_x509_dn_get_rdn_ava()' .

     Note that 'dn' should be treated as constant.  Because it points
     into the 'cert' object, you should not use 'dn' after 'cert' is
     deallocated.

     *Returns:* Returns 0 on success, or an error code.

gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_alt_name
-----------------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_alt_name (gnutls_x509_crt_t

          unsigned int * CRITICAL)
     CERT: should contain a 'gnutls_x509_crt_t' type

     SEQ: specifies the sequence number of the alt name (0 for the first
     one, 1 for the second etc.)

     IAN: is the place where the alternative name will be copied to

     IAN_SIZE: holds the size of ian.

     CRITICAL: will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical
     (may be null)

     This function retrieves the Issuer Alternative Name (2.5.29.18),
     contained in the given certificate in the X509v3 Certificate
     Extensions.

     When the SAN type is otherName, it will extract the data in the
     otherName's value field, and 'GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME' is returned.
     You may use 'gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_othername_oid()' to
     get the corresponding OID and the "virtual" SAN types (e.g.,
     'GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_XMPP' ).

     If an otherName OID is known, the data will be decoded.  Otherwise
     the returned data will be DER encoded, and you will have to decode
     it yourself.  Currently, only the RFC 3920 id-on-xmppAddr Issuer
     AltName is recognized.

     *Returns:* the alternative issuer name type on success, one of the
     enumerated 'gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t' .  It will return
     'GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER' if 'ian_size' is not large enough to
     hold the value.  In that case 'ian_size' will be updated with the
     required size.  If the certificate does not have an Alternative
     name with the specified sequence number then
     'GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE' is returned.

     *Since:* 2.10.0

gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_alt_name2
------------------------------------

     one, 1 for the second etc.)

     IAN: is the place where the alternative name will be copied to

     IAN_SIZE: holds the size of ret.

     IAN_TYPE: holds the type of the alternative name (one of
     gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t).

     CRITICAL: will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical
     (may be null)

     This function will return the alternative names, contained in the
     given certificate.  It is the same as
     'gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_alt_name()' except for the fact that it
     will return the type of the alternative name in 'ian_type' even if
     the function fails for some reason (i.e.  the buffer provided is
     not enough).

     *Returns:* the alternative issuer name type on success, one of the
     enumerated 'gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t' .  It will return
     'GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER' if 'ian_size' is not large enough to
     hold the value.  In that case 'ian_size' will be updated with the
     required size.  If the certificate does not have an Alternative
     name with the specified sequence number then
     'GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE' is returned.

     *Since:* 2.10.0

     CERT: should contain a 'gnutls_x509_crt_t' type

     SEQ: specifies the sequence number of the alt name (0 for the first
     one, 1 for the second etc.)

     RET: is the place where the otherName OID will be copied to

     RET_SIZE: holds the size of ret.

     This function will extract the type OID of an otherName Subject
     Alternative Name, contained in the given certificate, and return
     the type as an enumerated element.

     If 'oid' is null then only the size will be filled.  The 'oid'
     returned will be null terminated, although 'oid_size' will not
     account for the trailing null.

     This function is only useful if
     'gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_alt_name()' returned
     'GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME' .

     *Returns:* the alternative issuer name type on success, one of the
     enumerated gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t.  For supported OIDs, it
     will return one of the virtual (GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_*) types, e.g.
     'GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_XMPP' , and 'GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME' for
     unknown OIDs.  It will return 'GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER' if
     'ret_size' is not large enough to hold the value.  In that case
     'ret_size' will be updated with the required size.  If the
     certificate does not have an Alternative name with the specified
     sequence number and with the otherName type then
     'GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE' is returned.

     *Since:* 2.10.0

gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_dn
-----------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_dn (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT,

     BUF_SIZE: initially holds the size of 'buf'

     This function will copy the name of the Certificate issuer in the
     provided buffer.  The name will be in the form
     "C=xxxx,O=yyyy,CN=zzzz" as described in RFC4514.  The output string
     will be ASCII or UTF-8 encoded, depending on the certificate data.

     If 'buf' is null then only the size will be filled.

     This function does not output a fully RFC4514 compliant string, if
     that is required see 'gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_dn3()' .

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER' if the provided buffer is
     not long enough, and in that case the 'buf_size' will be updated
     with the required size.  'GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE' if
     the DN does not exist, or another error value on error.  On success
     0 is returned.

gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_dn2
------------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_dn2 (gnutls_x509_crt_t
          CERT, gnutls_datum_t * DN)
     CERT: should contain a 'gnutls_x509_crt_t' type

     DN: a pointer to a structure to hold the name

     This function will allocate buffer and copy the name of issuer of
     the Certificate.  The name will be in the form
     "C=xxxx,O=yyyy,CN=zzzz" as described in RFC4514.  The output string
     will be ASCII or UTF-8 encoded, depending on the certificate data.

     This function does not output a fully RFC4514 compliant string, if
     that is required see 'gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_dn3()' .

     DN: a pointer to a structure to hold the name

     FLAGS: zero or 'GNUTLS_X509_DN_FLAG_COMPAT'

     This function will allocate buffer and copy the name of issuer of
     the Certificate.  The name will be in the form
     "C=xxxx,O=yyyy,CN=zzzz" as described in RFC4514.  The output string
     will be ASCII or UTF-8 encoded, depending on the certificate data.

     When the flag 'GNUTLS_X509_DN_FLAG_COMPAT' is specified, the output
     format will match the format output by previous to 3.5.6 versions
     of GnuTLS which was not not fully RFC4514-compliant.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,

     BUF: a pointer to a structure to hold the name (may be null)

     BUF_SIZE: initially holds the size of 'buf'

     This function will extract the part of the name of the Certificate
     issuer specified by the given OID. The output, if the raw flag is
     not used, will be encoded as described in RFC4514.  Thus a string
     that is ASCII or UTF-8 encoded, depending on the certificate data.

     Some helper macros with popular OIDs can be found in gnutls/x509.h
     If raw flag is (0), this function will only return known OIDs as
     text.  Other OIDs will be DER encoded, as described in RFC4514 - in
     hex format with a '#' prefix.  You can check about known OIDs using
     'gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known()' .

     If 'buf' is null then only the size will be filled.  If the
     'raw_flag' is not specified the output is always null terminated,
     although the 'buf_size' will not include the null character.

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER' if the provided buffer is
     not long enough, and in that case the 'buf_size' will be updated
     with the required size.  'GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE' if
     there are no data in the current index.  On success 0 is returned.

     OID_SIZE: initially holds the size of 'oid'

     This function will extract the OIDs of the name of the Certificate
     issuer specified by the given index.

     If 'oid' is null then only the size will be filled.  The 'oid'
     returned will be null terminated, although 'oid_size' will not
     account for the trailing null.

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER' if the provided buffer is
     not long enough, and in that case the 'buf_size' will be updated
     with the required size.  'GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE' if

     BUF: user allocated memory buffer, will hold the unique id

     BUF_SIZE: size of user allocated memory buffer (on input), will
     hold actual size of the unique ID on return.

     This function will extract the issuerUniqueID value (if present)
     for the given certificate.

     If the user allocated memory buffer is not large enough to hold the
     full subjectUniqueID, then a GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER error
     will be returned, and buf_size will be set to the actual length.

     This function had a bug prior to 3.4.8 that prevented the setting
     of 'NULL' 'buf' to discover the 'buf_size' .  To use this function
     safely with the older versions the 'buf' must be a valid buffer
     that can hold at least a single byte if 'buf_size' is zero.

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' on success, otherwise a negative
     error code.

     *Since:* 2.12.0

     This function will return a unique ID that depends on the public
     key parameters.  This ID can be used in checking whether a
     certificate corresponds to the given private key.

     If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then
     *output_data_size is updated and GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER will
     be returned.  The output will normally be a SHA-1 hash output,
     which is 20 bytes.

     *Returns:* In case of failure a negative error code will be
     returned, and 0 on success.

     verify whether a server's name is in accordance with the
     constraints.

     When the 'flags' is set to 'GNUTLS_EXT_FLAG_APPEND' , then if the
     'nc' structure is empty this function will behave identically as if
     the flag was not set.  Otherwise if there are elements in the 'nc'
     structure then the constraints will be merged with the existing
     constraints following RFC5280 p6.1.4 (excluded constraints will be
     appended, permitted will be intersected).

     Note that 'nc' must be initialized prior to calling this function.

     When the SAN type is otherName, it will extract the data in the
     otherName's value field, and 'GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME' is returned.
     You may use 'gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_othername_oid()' to
     get the corresponding OID and the "virtual" SAN types (e.g.,
     'GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_XMPP' ).

     If an otherName OID is known, the data will be decoded.  Otherwise
     the returned data will be DER encoded, and you will have to decode
     it yourself.  Currently, only the RFC 3920 id-on-xmppAddr SAN is
     recognized.

     *Returns:* the alternative subject name type on success, one of the
     enumerated 'gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t' .  It will return
     'GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER' if 'san_size' is not large enough to
     hold the value.  In that case 'san_size' will be updated with the

     (may be null)

     This function will return the alternative names, contained in the
     given certificate.  It is the same as
     'gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name()' except for the fact that
     it will return the type of the alternative name in 'san_type' even
     if the function fails for some reason (i.e.  the buffer provided is
     not enough).

     *Returns:* the alternative subject name type on success, one of the
     enumerated 'gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t' .  It will return
     'GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER' if 'san_size' is not large enough to
     hold the value.  In that case 'san_size' will be updated with the

     one, 1 for the second etc.)

     OID: is the place where the otherName OID will be copied to

     OID_SIZE: holds the size of ret.

     This function will extract the type OID of an otherName Subject
     Alternative Name, contained in the given certificate, and return
     the type as an enumerated element.

     This function is only useful if
     'gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name()' returned
     'GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME' .

     If 'oid' is null then only the size will be filled.  The 'oid'
     returned will be null terminated, although 'oid_size' will not
     account for the trailing null.

     *Returns:* the alternative subject name type on success, one of the
     enumerated gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t.  For supported OIDs, it
     will return one of the virtual (GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_*) types, e.g.
     'GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_XMPP' , and 'GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME' for
     unknown OIDs.  It will return 'GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER' if
     'ian_size' is not large enough to hold the value.  In that case
     'ian_size' will be updated with the required size.  If the
     certificate does not have an Alternative name with the specified
     sequence number and with the otherName type then
     'GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE' is returned.

gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_key_id
----------------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_key_id (gnutls_x509_crt_t

     BUF: user allocated memory buffer, will hold the unique id

     BUF_SIZE: size of user allocated memory buffer (on input), will
     hold actual size of the unique ID on return.

     This function will extract the subjectUniqueID value (if present)
     for the given certificate.

     If the user allocated memory buffer is not large enough to hold the
     full subjectUniqueID, then a GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER error
     will be returned, and buf_size will be set to the actual length.

     This function had a bug prior to 3.4.8 that prevented the setting
     of 'NULL' 'buf' to discover the 'buf_size' .  To use this function
     safely with the older versions the 'buf' must be a valid buffer
     that can hold at least a single byte if 'buf_size' is zero.

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' on success, otherwise a negative
     error code.

     using 'gnutls_x509_tlsfeatures_deinit()' .

     When the 'flags' is set to 'GNUTLS_EXT_FLAG_APPEND' , then if the
     'features' structure is empty this function will behave identically
     as if the flag was not set.  Otherwise if there are elements in the
     'features' structure then they will be merged with.

     Note that 'features' must be initialized prior to calling this
     function.

     in 'certs' .  They will be automatically initialized.

     The flag 'GNUTLS_X509_CRT_LIST_IMPORT_FAIL_IF_EXCEED' will cause
     import to fail if the certificates in the provided buffer are more
     than the available structures.  The
     'GNUTLS_X509_CRT_LIST_FAIL_IF_UNSORTED' flag will cause the
     function to fail if the provided list is not sorted from subject to
     issuer.

     If the Certificate is PEM encoded it should have a header of "X509

     certificate naming style.  Note that if 'name' is 'NULL' , you MUST
     set it later by using 'gnutls_x509_crt_set_dn_by_oid()' or similar.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

gnutls_x509_crt_set_serial
--------------------------

          const void * SERIAL, size_t SERIAL_SIZE)
     CERT: a certificate of type 'gnutls_x509_crt_t'

     SERIAL: The serial number

     SERIAL_SIZE: Holds the size of the serial field.

     This function will set the X.509 certificate's serial number.
     While the serial number is an integer, it is often handled as an
     opaque field by several CAs.  For this reason this function accepts
     any kind of data as a serial number.  To be consistent with the
     X.509/PKIX specifications the provided 'serial' should be a
     big-endian positive number (i.e.  it's leftmost bit should be
     zero).

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

gnutls_x509_crt_set_subject_alt_name
------------------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crt_set_subject_alt_name
          (gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT, gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t TYPE,
          const void * DATA, unsigned int DATA_SIZE, unsigned int FLAGS)
     CRT: a certificate of type 'gnutls_x509_crt_t'

     TYPE: is one of the gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t enumerations

     DATA: The data to be set

     DATA_SIZE: The size of data to be set

     FLAGS: GNUTLS_FSAN_SET to clear previous data or GNUTLS_FSAN_APPEND
     to append.

     This function will set the subject alternative name certificate
     extension.  It can set the following types: 'GNUTLS_SAN_DNSNAME' as
     a text string, 'GNUTLS_SAN_RFC822NAME' as a text string,
     'GNUTLS_SAN_URI' as a text string, 'GNUTLS_SAN_IPADDRESS' as a
     binary IP address (4 or 16 bytes), 'GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_XMPP' as a
     UTF8 string (since 3.5.0).

     Since version 3.5.7 the 'GNUTLS_SAN_RFC822NAME' ,
     'GNUTLS_SAN_DNSNAME' , and 'GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_XMPP' are
     converted to ACE format when necessary.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 2.6.0

-----------------------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crt_set_subject_alt_othername
          (gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT, const char * OID, const void * DATA,
          unsigned int DATA_SIZE, unsigned int FLAGS)
     CRT: a certificate of type 'gnutls_x509_crt_t'

     OID: The other name OID

     DATA: The data to be set

     DATA_SIZE: The size of data to be set

     FLAGS: GNUTLS_FSAN_SET to clear previous data or GNUTLS_FSAN_APPEND
     to append.

     This function will set an "othername" to the subject alternative
     name certificate extension.

     The values set are set as binary values and are expected to have
     the proper DER encoding.  For convenience the flags
     'GNUTLS_FSAN_ENCODE_OCTET_STRING' and
     'GNUTLS_FSAN_ENCODE_UTF8_STRING' can be used to encode the provided
     data.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.5.0

     TYPE: is one of the gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t enumerations

     DATA_STRING: The data to be set, a (0) terminated string

     This function will set the subject alternative name certificate
     extension.  This function assumes that data can be expressed as a
     null terminated string.

     The name of the function is unfortunate since it is inconsistent
     with 'gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name()' .

     See 'gnutls_x509_crt_set_subject_alt_name()' for more information.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     This function will set the X.509 certificate's subject unique ID
     field.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.4.7

gnutls_x509_crt_set_tlsfeatures
-------------------------------

          CRT, gnutls_x509_tlsfeatures_t FEATURES)
     CRT: A X.509 certificate

     FEATURES: If the function succeeds, the features will be added to
     the certificate.

     This function will set the certificates X.509 TLS extension from
     the given structure.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.5.1

gnutls_x509_crt_set_version
---------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crt_set_version (gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT,
          unsigned int VERSION)
     CRT: a certificate of type 'gnutls_x509_crt_t'

     VERSION: holds the version number.  For X.509v1 certificates must
     be 1.

     This function will set the version of the certificate.  This must
     be one for X.509 version 1, and so on.  Plain certificates without
     extensions must have version set to one.

     To create well-formed certificates, you must specify version 3 if
     you use any certificate extensions.  Extensions are created by
     functions such as 'gnutls_x509_crt_set_subject_alt_name()' or
     'gnutls_x509_crt_set_key_usage()' .

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

gnutls_x509_crt_sign
--------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crt_sign (gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT,

     ISSUER: is the certificate of the certificate issuer

     ISSUER_KEY: holds the issuer's private key

     This function is the same a 'gnutls_x509_crt_sign2()' with no
     flags, and SHA1 as the hash algorithm.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

gnutls_x509_crt_sign2
---------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crt_sign2 (gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT,
          gnutls_x509_crt_t ISSUER, gnutls_x509_privkey_t ISSUER_KEY,

     CRT: a certificate of type 'gnutls_x509_crt_t'

     ISSUER: is the certificate of the certificate issuer

     ISSUER_KEY: holds the issuer's private key

     DIG: The message digest to use, 'GNUTLS_DIG_SHA256' is a safe
     choice

     FLAGS: must be 0

     This function will sign the certificate with the issuer's private
     key, and will copy the issuer's information into the certificate.

     This must be the last step in a certificate generation since all
     the previously set parameters are now signed.

     A known limitation of this function is, that a newly-signed
     certificate will not be fully functional (e.g., for signature
     verification), until it is exported an re-imported.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

gnutls_x509_crt_verify
----------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crt_verify (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, const

     CERT: is the certificate to be verified

     CA_LIST: is one certificate that is considered to be trusted one

     CA_LIST_LENGTH: holds the number of CA certificate in CA_list

     FLAGS: Flags that may be used to change the verification algorithm.
     Use OR of the gnutls_certificate_verify_flags enumerations.

     VERIFY: will hold the certificate verification output.

     This function will try to verify the given certificate and return
     its status.  Note that a verification error does not imply a
     negative return status.  In that case the 'verify' status is set.

     The details of the verification are the same as in
     'gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt2()' .

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     CRT: Holds the certificate to verify with

     ALGO: The signature algorithm used

     FLAGS: Zero or an OR list of 'gnutls_certificate_verify_flags'

     DATA: holds the signed data

     SIGNATURE: contains the signature

     This function will verify the given signed data, using the
     parameters from the certificate.

     *Returns:* In case of a verification failure
     'GNUTLS_E_PK_SIG_VERIFY_FAILED' is returned, 'GNUTLS_E_EXPIRED' or
     'GNUTLS_E_NOT_YET_ACTIVATED' on expired or not yet activated
     certificate and zero or positive code on success.

     Note that since GnuTLS 3.5.6 this function introduces checks in the
     end certificate ( 'crt' ), including time checks and key usage
     checks.

     *Since:* 3.4.0

     DN: a DN uint8_t object pointer.

     This function deallocates the DN object as returned by
     'gnutls_x509_dn_import()' .

     *Since:* 2.4.0

gnutls_x509_dn_export
---------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_dn_export (gnutls_x509_dn_t DN,

     OUTPUT_DATA_SIZE: holds the size of output_data (and will be
     replaced by the actual size of parameters)

     This function will export the DN to DER or PEM format.

     If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then
     * 'output_data_size' is updated and 'GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER'
     will be returned.

     If the structure is PEM encoded, it will have a header of "BEGIN
     NAME".

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

gnutls_x509_dn_export2
----------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_dn_export2 (gnutls_x509_dn_t DN,
          gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, gnutls_datum_t * OUT)
     DN: Holds the uint8_t DN object

     FORMAT: the format of output params.  One of PEM or DER.

     OUT: will contain a DN PEM or DER encoded

     This function will export the DN to DER or PEM format.

     The output buffer is allocated using 'gnutls_malloc()' .

     If the structure is PEM encoded, it will have a header of "BEGIN

     DN: a pointer to DN

     IRDN: index of RDN

     IAVA: index of AVA.

     AVA: Pointer to structure which will hold output information.

     Get pointers to data within the DN. The format of the 'ava'
     structure is shown below.

     struct gnutls_x509_ava_st { gnutls_datum_t oid; gnutls_datum_t
     value; unsigned long value_tag; };

     The X.509 distinguished name is a sequence of sequences of strings
     and this is what the 'irdn' and 'iava' indexes model.

     Note that 'ava' will contain pointers into the 'dn' structure which
     in turns points to the original certificate.  Thus you should not
     modify any data or deallocate any of those.

     This is a low-level function that requires the caller to do the
     value conversions when necessary (e.g.  from UCS-2).

     *Returns:* Returns 0 on success, or an error code.

gnutls_x509_dn_get_str
----------------------

     This function will allocate buffer and copy the name in the
     provided DN. The name will be in the form "C=xxxx,O=yyyy,CN=zzzz"
     as described in RFC4514.  The output string will be ASCII or UTF-8
     encoded, depending on the certificate data.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.4.2

gnutls_x509_dn_get_str2

     STR: a datum that will hold the name

     FLAGS: zero or 'GNUTLS_X509_DN_FLAG_COMPAT'

     This function will allocate buffer and copy the name in the
     provided DN. The name will be in the form "C=xxxx,O=yyyy,CN=zzzz"
     as described in RFC4514.  The output string will be ASCII or UTF-8
     encoded, depending on the certificate data.

     When the flag 'GNUTLS_X509_DN_FLAG_COMPAT' is specified, the output
     format will match the format output by previous to 3.5.6 versions
     of GnuTLS which was not not fully RFC4514-compliant.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.5.7

     DATA: should contain a DER encoded RDN sequence

     This function parses an RDN sequence and stores the result to a
     'gnutls_x509_dn_t' type.  The data must have been initialized with
     'gnutls_x509_dn_init()' .  You may use
     'gnutls_x509_dn_get_rdn_ava()' to decode the DN.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 2.4.0

------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known (const char * OID)
     OID: holds an Object Identifier in a null terminated string

     This function will inform about known DN OIDs.  This is useful
     since functions like 'gnutls_x509_crt_set_dn_by_oid()' use the
     information on known OIDs to properly encode their input.  Object
     Identifiers that are not known are not encoded by these functions,
     and their input is stored directly into the ASN.1 structure.  In
     that case of unknown OIDs, you have the responsibility of DER
     encoding your data.

     *Returns:* 1 on known OIDs and 0 otherwise.

gnutls_x509_dn_oid_name
-----------------------

 -- Function: const char * gnutls_x509_dn_oid_name (const char * OID,

     key.

     The 'password' can be either ASCII or UTF-8 in the default PBES2
     encryption schemas, or ASCII for the PKCS12 schemas.

     If the Certificate is PEM encoded it should have a header of
     "ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY", or "PRIVATE KEY". You only need to specify
     the flags if the key is DER encoded, since in that case the
     encryption status cannot be auto-detected.

     If the 'GNUTLS_PKCS_PLAIN' flag is specified and the supplied data
     are encrypted then 'GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED' is returned.

     CERT_LIST: is the certificate list to be verified

     CERT_LIST_SIZE: is the certificate list size

     DATA: an array of typed data

     ELEMENTS: the number of data elements

     FLAGS: Flags that may be used to change the verification algorithm.
     Use OR of the gnutls_certificate_verify_flags enumerations.

     VOUTPUT: will hold the certificate verification output.

     FUNC: If non-null will be called on each chain element verification
     with the output.

     This function will attempt to verify the given certificate chain
     and return its status.  The 'voutput' parameter will hold an OR'ed
     sequence of 'gnutls_certificate_status_t' flags.

     When a certificate chain of 'cert_list_size' with more than one
     certificates is provided, the verification status will apply to the
     first certificate in the chain that failed verification.  The
     verification process starts from the end of the chain (from CA to
     end certificate).  The first certificate in the chain must be the
     end-certificate while the rest of the members may be sorted or not.

     Additionally a certificate verification profile can be specified
     from the ones in 'gnutls_certificate_verification_profiles_t' by
     ORing the result of 'GNUTLS_PROFILE_TO_VFLAGS()' to the
     verification flags.

     Additional verification parameters are possible via the 'data'
     types; the acceptable types are 'GNUTLS_DT_DNS_HOSTNAME' and
     'GNUTLS_DT_KEY_PURPOSE_OID' .  The former accepts as data a
     null-terminated hostname, and the latter a null-terminated object
     identifier (e.g., 'GNUTLS_KP_TLS_WWW_SERVER' ).  If a DNS hostname
     is provided then this function will compare the hostname in the end
     certificate against the given.  If names do not match the
     'GNUTLS_CERT_UNEXPECTED_OWNER' status flag will be set.  In
     addition it will consider certificates provided with
     'gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_named_crt()' .

     If a key purpose OID is provided and the end-certificate contains
     the extended key usage PKIX extension, it will be required to match
     the provided OID or be marked for any purpose, otherwise
     verification will fail with 'GNUTLS_CERT_PURPOSE_MISMATCH' status.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.  Note that verification failure
     will not result to an error code, only 'voutput' will be updated.

     *Since:* 3.3.8

     VOUTPUT: will hold the certificate verification output.

     FUNC: If non-null will be called on each chain element verification
     with the output.

     This function will try to find a certificate that is associated
     with the provided name -see
     'gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_named_crt()' .  If a match is found the
     certificate is considered valid.  In addition to that this function
     will also check CRLs.  The 'voutput' parameter will hold an OR'ed
     sequence of 'gnutls_certificate_status_t' flags.

     Additionally a certificate verification profile can be specified
     from the ones in 'gnutls_certificate_verification_profiles_t' by
     ORing the result of 'GNUTLS_PROFILE_TO_VFLAGS()' to the
     verification flags.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

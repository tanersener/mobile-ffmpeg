.SH NAME
gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_file \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_file(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t " sc ", const char * " response_file ", unsigned " idx ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_certificate_credentials_t sc" 12
is a credentials structure.
.IP "const char * response_file" 12
a filename of the OCSP response
.IP "unsigned idx" 12
is a certificate index as returned by \fBgnutls_certificate_set_key()\fP and friends
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets the filename of an OCSP response, that will be
sent to the client if requests an OCSP certificate status for
the certificate chain specified by  \fIidx\fP .

This is a convenience function which may be inefficient on busy servers since
the file is opened on every access. Use 
\fBgnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_function2()\fP to fine\-tune
file accesses.
.SH "NOTE"
the ability to set multiple OCSP responses per credential
structure via the index  \fIidx\fP was added in version 3.5.6. To keep
backwards compatibility, it requires using \fBgnutls_certificate_set_flags()\fP
with the \fBGNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_API_V2\fP flag to make the set certificate
functions return an index usable by this function.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned,
otherwise a negative error code is returned.
.SH "SINCE"
3.1.3
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is to be used by clients to request OCSP response
from the server, using the "status_request" TLS extension.  Only
OCSP status type is supported.

Previous versions of GnuTLS supported setting  \fIresponder_id\fP and
 \fIextensions\fP fields, but due to the difficult semantics of the
parameter usage, and other issues, this support was removed
since 3.6.0 and these parameters must be set to \fBNULL\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned,
otherwise a negative error code is returned.
.SH "SINCE"
3.1.3

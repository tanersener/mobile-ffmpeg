.SH NAME
gnutls_pcert_import_x509_list \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/abstract.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_pcert_import_x509_list(gnutls_pcert_st * " pcert_list ", gnutls_x509_crt_t * " crt ", unsigned * " ncrt ", unsigned int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_pcert_st * pcert_list" 12
The structures to store the certificates; must not contain initialized \fBgnutls_pcert_st\fP structures.
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t * crt" 12
The certificates to be imported
.IP "unsigned * ncrt" 12
The number of certificates in  \fIcrt\fP ; will be updated if necessary
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
zero or \fBGNUTLS_X509_CRT_LIST_SORT\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This convenience function will import the given certificates to an
already allocated set of \fBgnutls_pcert_st\fP structures. The structures must
be deinitialized afterwards using \fBgnutls_pcert_deinit()\fP.  \fIpcert_list\fP should contain space for at least  \fIncrt\fP elements.

In the case \fBGNUTLS_X509_CRT_LIST_SORT\fP is specified and that
function cannot sort the list, \fBGNUTLS_E_CERTIFICATE_LIST_UNSORTED\fP
will be returned. Currently sorting can fail if the list size
exceeds an internal constraint (16).
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
.SH "SINCE"
3.4.0

.SH NAME
gnutls_record_send_early_data \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "ssize_t gnutls_record_send_early_data(gnutls_session_t " session ", const void * " data ", size_t " data_size ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP type.
.IP "const void * data" 12
contains the data to send
.IP "size_t data_size" 12
is the length of the data
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function can be used by a client to send data early in the
handshake processes when resuming a session.  This is used to
implement a zero\-roundtrip (0\-RTT) mode.  It has the same semantics
as \fBgnutls_record_send()\fP.

There may be a limit to the amount of data sent as early data.  Use
\fBgnutls_record_get_max_early_data_size()\fP to check the limit.  If the
limit exceeds, this function returns
\fBGNUTLS_E_RECORD_LIMIT_REACHED\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
The number of bytes sent, or a negative error code.  The
number of bytes sent might be less than  \fIdata_size\fP .  The maximum
number of bytes this function can send in a single call depends
on the negotiated maximum record size.
.SH "SINCE"
3.6.5
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"

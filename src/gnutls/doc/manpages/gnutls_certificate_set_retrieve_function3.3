.SH NAME
gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function3 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/abstract.h>
.sp
.BI "void gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function3(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t " cred ", gnutls_certificate_retrieve_function3 * " func ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_certificate_credentials_t cred" 12
is a \fBgnutls_certificate_credentials_t\fP type.
.IP "gnutls_certificate_retrieve_function3 * func" 12
is the callback function
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets a callback to be called in order to retrieve the
certificate and OCSP responses to be used in the handshake.  \fIfunc\fP will
be called only if the peer requests a certificate either during handshake
or during post\-handshake authentication.

The callback's function prototype is defined in `abstract.h':
int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, const struct gnutls_cert_retr_st *info,
gnutls_pcert_st **certs, unsigned int *pcert_length,
gnutls_datum_t **ocsp, unsigned int *ocsp_length,
gnutls_privkey_t * pkey, unsigned int *flags);

The info field of the callback contains:
 \fIreq_ca_dn\fP which is a list with the CA names that the server considers trusted.
This is a hint and typically the client should send a certificate that is signed
by one of these CAs. These names, when available, are DER encoded. To get a more
meaningful value use the function \fBgnutls_x509_rdn_get()\fP.
 \fIpk_algos\fP contains a list with server's acceptable public key algorithms.
The certificate returned should support the server's given algorithms.

The callback should fill\-in the following values.

 \fIpcert\fP should contain an allocated list of certificates and public keys.
 \fIpcert_length\fP is the size of the previous list.
 \fIocsp\fP should contain an allocated list of OCSP responses.
 \fIocsp_length\fP is the size of the previous list.
 \fIpkey\fP is the private key.

If flags in the callback are set to \fBGNUTLS_CERT_RETR_DEINIT_ALL\fP then
all provided values must be allocated using \fBgnutls_malloc()\fP, and will
be released by gnutls; otherwise they will not be touched by gnutls.

The callback function should set the certificate and OCSP response
list to be sent, and return 0 on success. If no certificates are available,
the  \fIpcert_length\fP and  \fIocsp_length\fP should be set to zero. The return
value (\-1) indicates error and the handshake will be terminated. If both
certificates are set in the credentials and a callback is available, the
callback takes predence.

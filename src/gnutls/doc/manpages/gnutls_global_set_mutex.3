.SH "DESCRIPTION"
With this function you are allowed to override the default mutex
locks used in some parts of gnutls and dependent libraries. This function
should be used if you have complete control of your program and libraries.
Do not call this function from a library, or preferably from any application
unless really needed to. GnuTLS will use the appropriate locks for the running
system.

Note that since the move to implicit initialization of GnuTLS on library
load, calling this function will deinitialize the library, and re\-initialize
it after the new locking functions are set.

This function must be called prior to any other gnutls function.

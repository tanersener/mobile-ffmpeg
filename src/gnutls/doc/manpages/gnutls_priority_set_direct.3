.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sets the priorities to use on the ciphers, key exchange methods,
macs and compression methods.  This function avoids keeping a
priority cache and is used to directly set string priorities to a
TLS session.  For documentation check the \fBgnutls_priority_init()\fP.

To simply use a reasonable default, consider using \fBgnutls_set_default_priority()\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
On syntax error \fBGNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST\fP is returned,
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, or an error code.

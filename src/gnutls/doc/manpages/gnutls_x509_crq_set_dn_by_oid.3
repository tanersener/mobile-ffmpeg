.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crq_set_dn_by_oid \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crq_set_dn_by_oid(gnutls_x509_crq_t " crq ", const char * " oid ", unsigned int " raw_flag ", const void * " data ", unsigned int " sizeof_data ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crq_t crq" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_x509_crq_t\fP type
.IP "const char * oid" 12
holds an Object Identifier in a (0)\-terminated string
.IP "unsigned int raw_flag" 12
must be 0, or 1 if the data are DER encoded
.IP "const void * data" 12
a pointer to the input data
.IP "unsigned int sizeof_data" 12
holds the size of  \fIdata\fP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will set the part of the name of the Certificate
request subject, specified by the given OID.  The input string
should be ASCII or UTF\-8 encoded.

Some helper macros with popular OIDs can be found in gnutls/x509.h
With this function you can only set the known OIDs.  You can test
for known OIDs using \fBgnutls_x509_dn_oid_known()\fP.  For OIDs that are
not known (by gnutls) you should properly DER encode your data, and
call this function with raw_flag set.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.

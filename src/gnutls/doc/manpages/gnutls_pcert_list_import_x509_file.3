.sp
.BI "int gnutls_pcert_list_import_x509_file(gnutls_pcert_st * " pcert_list ", unsigned * " pcert_list_size ", const char * " file ", gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t " format ", gnutls_pin_callback_t " pin_fn ", void * " pin_fn_userdata ", unsigned int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_pcert_st * pcert_list" 12
The structures to store the certificates; must not contain initialized \fBgnutls_pcert_st\fP structures.
.IP "unsigned * pcert_list_size" 12
Initially must hold the maximum number of certs. It will be updated with the number of certs available.
.IP "const char * file" 12
A file or supported URI with the certificates to load
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format" 12
\fBGNUTLS_X509_FMT_DER\fP or \fBGNUTLS_X509_FMT_PEM\fP if a file is given
.IP "gnutls_pin_callback_t pin_fn" 12
a PIN callback if not globally set
.IP "void * pin_fn_userdata" 12
parameter for the PIN callback
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
zero or flags from \fBgnutls_certificate_import_flags\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This convenience function will import a certificate chain from the given
file or supported URI to \fBgnutls_pcert_st\fP structures. The structures
must be deinitialized afterwards using \fBgnutls_pcert_deinit()\fP.

This function will always return a sorted certificate chain.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value; if the  \fIpcert\fP list doesn't have enough space

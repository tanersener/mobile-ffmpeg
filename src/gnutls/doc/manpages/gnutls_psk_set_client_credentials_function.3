.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the username and
password for client PSK authentication.
The callback's function form is:
int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, char** username,
gnutls_datum_t* key);

The  \fIusername\fP and  \fIkey\fP \->data must be allocated using \fBgnutls_malloc()\fP.
The  \fIusername\fP should be an ASCII string or UTF\-8
string. In case of a UTF\-8 string it is recommended to be following
the PRECIS framework for usernames (rfc8265).

The callback function will be called once per handshake.

The callback function should return 0 on success.
\-1 indicates an error.

is a \fBgnutls_certificate_credentials_t\fP type.
.IP "const char * certfile" 12
is a file that containing the certificate list (path) for
the specified private key, in PKCS7 format, or a list of certificates
.IP "const char * keyfile" 12
is a file that contains the private key
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t type" 12
is PEM or DER
.IP "const char * pass" 12
is the password of the key
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
an ORed sequence of gnutls_pkcs_encrypt_flags_t
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets a certificate/private key pair in the
gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type.  This function may be
called more than once, in case multiple keys/certificates exist for
the server.  For clients that need to send more than its own end
entity certificate, e.g., also an intermediate CA cert, then the
 \fIcertfile\fP must contain the ordered certificate chain.

Note that the names in the certificate provided will be considered
when selecting the appropriate certificate to use (in case of multiple
certificate/key pairs).

This function can also accept URLs at  \fIkeyfile\fP and  \fIcertfile\fP . In that case it
will use the private key and certificate indicated by the URLs. Note
that the supported URLs are the ones indicated by \fBgnutls_url_is_supported()\fP.
Before GnuTLS 3.4.0 when a URL was specified, the  \fIpass\fP part was ignored and a
PIN callback had to be registered, this is no longer the case in current releases.

In case the  \fIcertfile\fP is provided as a PKCS \fB11\fP URL, then the certificate, and its
present issuers in the token are imported (i.e., forming the required trust chain).

If that function fails to load the  \fIres\fP structure is at an undefined state, it must
not be reused to load other keys or certificates.

Note that, this function by default returns zero on success and a negative value on error.
Since 3.5.6, when the flag \fBGNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_API_V2\fP is set using \fBgnutls_certificate_set_flags()\fP
it returns an index (greater or equal to zero). That index can be used to other functions to refer to the added key\-pair.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success this functions returns zero, and otherwise a negative value on error (see above for modifying that behavior).

.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crt_get_fingerprint \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_get_fingerprint(gnutls_x509_crt_t " cert ", gnutls_digest_algorithm_t " algo ", void * " buf ", size_t * " buf_size ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t cert" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_x509_crt_t\fP type
.IP "gnutls_digest_algorithm_t algo" 12
is a digest algorithm
.IP "void * buf" 12
a pointer to a structure to hold the fingerprint (may be null)
.IP "size_t * buf_size" 12
initially holds the size of  \fIbuf\fP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will calculate and copy the certificate's fingerprint
in the provided buffer. The fingerprint is a hash of the DER\-encoded
data of the certificate.

If the buffer is null then only the size will be filled.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER\fP if the provided buffer is
not long enough, and in that case the *buf_size will be updated
with the required size.  On success 0 is returned.

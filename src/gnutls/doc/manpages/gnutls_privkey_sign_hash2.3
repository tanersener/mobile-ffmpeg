.SH NAME
gnutls_privkey_sign_hash2 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/abstract.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_privkey_sign_hash2(gnutls_privkey_t " signer ", gnutls_sign_algorithm_t " algo ", unsigned int " flags ", const gnutls_datum_t * " hash_data ", gnutls_datum_t * " signature ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_privkey_t signer" 12
Holds the signer's key
.IP "gnutls_sign_algorithm_t algo" 12
The signature algorithm used
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
Zero or one of \fBgnutls_privkey_flags_t\fP
.IP "const gnutls_datum_t * hash_data" 12
holds the data to be signed
.IP "gnutls_datum_t * signature" 12
will contain newly allocated signature
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will sign the given hashed data using a signature algorithm
supported by the private key. Signature algorithms are always used
together with a hash functions.  Different hash functions may be
used for the RSA algorithm, but only SHA\-XXX for the DSA keys.

You may use \fBgnutls_pubkey_get_preferred_hash_algorithm()\fP to determine
the hash algorithm.

The flags may be \fBGNUTLS_PRIVKEY_SIGN_FLAG_TLS1_RSA\fP or \fBGNUTLS_PRIVKEY_SIGN_FLAG_RSA_PSS\fP.
In the former case this function will ignore  \fIhash_algo\fP and perform a raw PKCS1 signature,
and in the latter an RSA\-PSS signature will be generated. Note that the flag
\fBGNUTLS_PRIVKEY_SIGN_FLAG_TLS1_RSA\fP is supported since 3.6.9.

Note that, not all algorithm support signing already hashed data. When
signing with Ed25519, \fBgnutls_privkey_sign_data()\fP should be used.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
.SH "SINCE"
3.6.0
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"

.SH NAME
gnutls_record_recv_early_data \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "ssize_t gnutls_record_recv_early_data(gnutls_session_t " session ", void * " data ", size_t " data_size ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP type.
.IP "void * data" 12
the buffer that the data will be read into
.IP "size_t data_size" 12
the number of requested bytes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function can be used by a searver to retrieve data sent early
in the handshake processes when resuming a session.  This is used
to implement a zero\-roundtrip (0\-RTT) mode.  It has the same
semantics as \fBgnutls_record_recv()\fP.

This function can be called either in a handshake hook, or after
the handshake is complete.
.SH "RETURNS"
The number of bytes received and zero when early data
reading is complete.  A negative error code is returned in case of
an error.  If no early data is received during the handshake, this
function returns \fBGNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE\fP.  The
number of bytes received might be less than the requested
 \fIdata_size\fP .
.SH "SINCE"
3.6.5

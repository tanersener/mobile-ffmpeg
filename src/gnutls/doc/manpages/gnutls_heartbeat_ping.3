.SH NAME
gnutls_heartbeat_ping \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_heartbeat_ping(gnutls_session_t " session ", size_t " data_size ", unsigned int " max_tries ", unsigned int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP type.
.IP "size_t data_size" 12
is the length of the ping payload.
.IP "unsigned int max_tries" 12
if flags is \fBGNUTLS_HEARTBEAT_WAIT\fP then this sets the number of retransmissions. Use zero for indefinite (until timeout).
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
if \fBGNUTLS_HEARTBEAT_WAIT\fP then wait for pong or timeout instead of returning immediately.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sends a ping to the peer. If the  \fIflags\fP is set
to \fBGNUTLS_HEARTBEAT_WAIT\fP then it waits for a reply from the peer.

Note that it is highly recommended to use this function with the
flag \fBGNUTLS_HEARTBEAT_WAIT\fP, or you need to handle retransmissions
and timeouts manually.

The total TLS data transmitted as part of the ping message are given by
the following formula: MAX(16,  \fIdata_size\fP )+\fBgnutls_record_overhead_size()\fP+3.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, otherwise a negative error code.
.SH "SINCE"
3.1.2

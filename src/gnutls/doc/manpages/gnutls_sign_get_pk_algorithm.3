.SH NAME
gnutls_sign_get_pk_algorithm \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "gnutls_pk_algorithm_t gnutls_sign_get_pk_algorithm(gnutls_sign_algorithm_t " sign ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_sign_algorithm_t sign" 12
is a signature algorithm
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function returns the public key algorithm corresponding to
the given signature algorithms. Note that there may be multiple
public key algorithms supporting a particular signature type;
when dealing with such algorithms use instead \fBgnutls_sign_supports_pk_algorithm()\fP.

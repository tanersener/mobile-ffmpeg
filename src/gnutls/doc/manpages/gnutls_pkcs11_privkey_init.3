.SH NAME
gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_init \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/pkcs11.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_init(gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_t * " key ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_t * key" 12
A pointer to the type to be initialized
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will initialize an private key structure. This
structure can be used for accessing an underlying PKCS\fB11\fP object.

In versions of GnuTLS later than 3.5.11 the object is protected
using locks and a single \fBgnutls_pkcs11_privkey_t\fP can be re\-used
by many threads. However, for performance it is recommended to utilize
one object per key per thread.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bugs@gnutls.org>.

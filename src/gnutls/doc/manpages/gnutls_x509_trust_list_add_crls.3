.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_crls \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_crls(gnutls_x509_trust_list_t " list ", const gnutls_x509_crl_t * " crl_list ", unsigned " crl_size ", unsigned int " flags ", unsigned int " verification_flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_trust_list_t list" 12
The list
.IP "const gnutls_x509_crl_t * crl_list" 12
A list of CRLs
.IP "unsigned crl_size" 12
The length of the CRL list
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
flags from \fBgnutls_trust_list_flags_t\fP
.IP "unsigned int verification_flags" 12
gnutls_certificate_verify_flags if flags specifies GNUTLS_TL_VERIFY_CRL
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will add the given certificate revocation lists
to the trusted list. The list of CRLs must not be deinitialized
during this structure's lifetime.

This function must be called after \fBgnutls_x509_trust_list_add_cas()\fP
to allow verifying the CRLs for validity. If the flag \fBGNUTLS_TL_NO_DUPLICATES\fP
is given, then any provided CRLs that are a duplicate, will be deinitialized
and not added to the list (that assumes that \fBgnutls_x509_trust_list_deinit()\fP
will be called with all=1).

If GNUTLS_TL_VERIFY_CRL is given the CRLs will be verified before being added.
.SH "RETURNS"
The number of added elements is returned.
.SH "SINCE"
3.0
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"

.SH NAME
gnutls_record_recv_seq \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "ssize_t gnutls_record_recv_seq(gnutls_session_t " session ", void * " data ", size_t " data_size ", unsigned char * " seq ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP type.
.IP "void * data" 12
the buffer that the data will be read into
.IP "size_t data_size" 12
the number of requested bytes
.IP "unsigned char * seq" 12
is the packet's 64\-bit sequence number. Should have space for 8 bytes.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is the same as \fBgnutls_record_recv()\fP, except that
it returns in addition to data, the sequence number of the data.
This is useful in DTLS where record packets might be received
out\-of\-order. The returned 8\-byte sequence number is an
integer in big\-endian format and should be
treated as a unique message identification. 
.SH "RETURNS"
The number of bytes received and zero on EOF.  A negative
error code is returned in case of an error.  The number of bytes
received might be less than  \fIdata_size\fP .
.SH "SINCE"
3.0
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"

.SH NAME
gnutls_global_init \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_global_init( " void ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP " void" 12
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Since GnuTLS 3.3.0 this function is no longer necessary to be explicitly
called. To disable the implicit call (in a library constructor) of this
function set the environment variable \fBGNUTLS_NO_EXPLICIT_INIT\fP to 1.

This function performs any required precalculations, detects
the supported CPU capabilities and initializes the underlying
cryptographic backend. In order to free any resources 
taken by this call you should \fBgnutls_global_deinit()\fP 
when gnutls usage is no longer needed.

This function increments a global counter, so that
\fBgnutls_global_deinit()\fP only releases resources when it has been
called as many times as \fBgnutls_global_init()\fP.  This is useful when
GnuTLS is used by more than one library in an application.  This
function can be called many times, but will only do something the
first time.

A subsequent call of this function if the initial has failed will
return the same error code.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned,
otherwise a negative error code is returned.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"

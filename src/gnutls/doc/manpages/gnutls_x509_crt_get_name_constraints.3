.IP "unsigned int * critical" 12
the extension status
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will return an intermediate type containing
the name constraints of the provided CA certificate. That
structure can be used in combination with \fBgnutls_x509_name_constraints_check()\fP
to verify whether a server's name is in accordance with the constraints.

When the  \fIflags\fP is set to \fBGNUTLS_EXT_FLAG_APPEND\fP,
then if the  \fInc\fP structure is empty this function will behave
identically as if the flag was not set.
Otherwise if there are elements in the  \fInc\fP structure then the
constraints will be merged with the existing constraints following
RFC5280 p6.1.4 (excluded constraints will be appended, permitted
will be intersected).

Note that  \fInc\fP must be initialized prior to calling this function.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, \fBGNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE\fP
if the extension is not present, otherwise a negative error value.
.SH "SINCE"
3.3.0

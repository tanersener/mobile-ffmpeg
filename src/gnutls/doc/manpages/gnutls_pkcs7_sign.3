.SH NAME
gnutls_pkcs7_sign \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/pkcs7.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_pkcs7_sign(gnutls_pkcs7_t " pkcs7 ", gnutls_x509_crt_t " signer ", gnutls_privkey_t " signer_key ", const gnutls_datum_t * " data ", gnutls_pkcs7_attrs_t " signed_attrs ", gnutls_pkcs7_attrs_t " unsigned_attrs ", gnutls_digest_algorithm_t " dig ", unsigned " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_pkcs7_t pkcs7" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_pkcs7_t\fP type
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t signer" 12
the certificate to sign the structure
.IP "gnutls_privkey_t signer_key" 12
the key to sign the structure
.IP "const gnutls_datum_t * data" 12
The data to be signed or \fBNULL\fP if the data are already embedded
.IP "gnutls_pkcs7_attrs_t signed_attrs" 12
Any additional attributes to be included in the signed ones (or \fBNULL\fP)
.IP "gnutls_pkcs7_attrs_t unsigned_attrs" 12
Any additional attributes to be included in the unsigned ones (or \fBNULL\fP)
.IP "gnutls_digest_algorithm_t dig" 12
The digest algorithm to use for signing
.IP "unsigned flags" 12
Should be zero or one of \fBGNUTLS_PKCS7\fP flags
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will add a signature in the provided PKCS \fB7\fP structure
for the provided data. Multiple signatures can be made with different
signers.

The available flags are:
\fBGNUTLS_PKCS7_EMBED_DATA\fP, \fBGNUTLS_PKCS7_INCLUDE_TIME\fP, \fBGNUTLS_PKCS7_INCLUDE_CERT\fP,
and \fBGNUTLS_PKCS7_WRITE_SPKI\fP. They are explained in the \fBgnutls_pkcs7_sign_flags\fP
definition.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
.SH "SINCE"
3.4.2
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"

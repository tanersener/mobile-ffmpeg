.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crl_get_issuer_dn_by_oid \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crl_get_issuer_dn_by_oid(gnutls_x509_crl_t " crl ", const char * " oid ", unsigned " indx ", unsigned int " raw_flag ", void * " buf ", size_t * " sizeof_buf ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crl_t crl" 12
should contain a gnutls_x509_crl_t type
.IP "const char * oid" 12
holds an Object Identified in null terminated string
.IP "unsigned indx" 12
In case multiple same OIDs exist in the RDN, this specifies which to send. Use (0) to get the first one.
.IP "unsigned int raw_flag" 12
If non\-zero returns the raw DER data of the DN part.
.IP "void * buf" 12
a pointer to a structure to hold the peer's name (may be null)
.IP "size_t * sizeof_buf" 12
initially holds the size of  \fIbuf\fP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will extract the part of the name of the CRL issuer
specified by the given OID. The output will be encoded as described
in RFC4514. The output string will be ASCII or UTF\-8 encoded,
depending on the certificate data.

Some helper macros with popular OIDs can be found in gnutls/x509.h
If raw flag is (0), this function will only return known OIDs as
text. Other OIDs will be DER encoded, as described in RFC4514 \-\- in
hex format with a '#' prefix.  You can check about known OIDs
using \fBgnutls_x509_dn_oid_known()\fP.

If buf is null then only the size will be filled.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER\fP if the provided buffer is
not long enough, and in that case the sizeof_buf will be updated
with the required size, and 0 on success.

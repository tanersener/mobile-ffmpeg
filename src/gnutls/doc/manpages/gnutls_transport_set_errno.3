.SH NAME
gnutls_transport_set_errno \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "void gnutls_transport_set_errno(gnutls_session_t " session ", int " err ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP type.
.IP "int err" 12
error value to store in session\-specific errno variable.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Store  \fIerr\fP in the session\-specific errno variable.  Useful values
for  \fIerr\fP are EINTR, EAGAIN and EMSGSIZE, other values are treated will be
treated as real errors in the push/pull function.

This function is useful in replacement push and pull functions set by
\fBgnutls_transport_set_push_function()\fP and
\fBgnutls_transport_set_pull_function()\fP under Windows, where the
replacements may not have access to the same  \fIerrno\fP variable that is used by GnuTLS (e.g., the application is linked to
msvcr71.dll and gnutls is linked to msvcrt.dll).

This function is unreliable if you are using the same
 \fIsession\fP in different threads for sending and receiving.

.SH NAME
gnutls_pkcs11_init \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/pkcs11.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_pkcs11_init(unsigned int " flags ", const char * " deprecated_config_file ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
An ORed sequence of \fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_\fP*
.IP "const char * deprecated_config_file" 12
either NULL or the location of a deprecated
configuration file
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will initialize the PKCS 11 subsystem in gnutls. It will
read configuration files if \fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_AUTO\fP is used or allow
you to independently load PKCS 11 modules using \fBgnutls_pkcs11_add_provider()\fP
if \fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_MANUAL\fP is specified.

You don't need to call this function since GnuTLS 3.3.0 because it is being called
during the first request PKCS 11 operation. That call will assume the \fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_AUTO\fP
flag. If another flags are required then it must be called independently
prior to any PKCS 11 operation.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
.SH "SINCE"
2.12.0
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"

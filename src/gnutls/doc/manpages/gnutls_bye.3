.SH NAME
gnutls_bye \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_bye(gnutls_session_t " session ", gnutls_close_request_t " how ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP type.
.IP "gnutls_close_request_t how" 12
is an integer
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Terminates the current TLS/SSL connection. The connection should
have been initiated using \fBgnutls_handshake()\fP.   \fIhow\fP should be one
of \fBGNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR\fP, \fBGNUTLS_SHUT_WR\fP.

In case of \fBGNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR\fP the TLS session gets
terminated and further receives and sends will be disallowed.  If
the return value is zero you may continue using the underlying
transport layer. \fBGNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR\fP sends an alert containing a close
request and waits for the peer to reply with the same message.

In case of \fBGNUTLS_SHUT_WR\fP the TLS session gets terminated
and further sends will be disallowed. In order to reuse the
connection you should wait for an EOF from the peer.
\fBGNUTLS_SHUT_WR\fP sends an alert containing a close request.

Note that not all implementations will properly terminate a TLS
connection.  Some of them, usually for performance reasons, will
terminate only the underlying transport layer, and thus not
distinguishing between a malicious party prematurely terminating
the connection and normal termination.

This function may also return \fBGNUTLS_E_AGAIN\fP or
\fBGNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED\fP; cf.  \fBgnutls_record_get_direction()\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, or an error code, see
function documentation for entire semantics.

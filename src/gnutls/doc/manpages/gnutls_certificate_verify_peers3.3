.SH NAME
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3(gnutls_session_t " session ", const char * " hostname ", unsigned int * " status ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a gnutls session
.IP "const char * hostname" 12
is the expected name of the peer; may be \fBNULL\fP
.IP "unsigned int * status" 12
is the output of the verification
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will verify the peer's certificate and store the
the status in the  \fIstatus\fP variable as a bitwise OR of gnutls_certificate_status_t
values or zero if the certificate is trusted. Note that value in  \fIstatus\fP is set only when the return value of this function is success (i.e, failure 
to trust a certificate does not imply a negative return value).
The default verification flags used by this function can be overridden
using \fBgnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags()\fP. See the documentation
of \fBgnutls_certificate_verify_peers2()\fP for details in the verification process.

This function will take into account the stapled OCSP responses sent by the server,
as well as the following X.509 certificate extensions: Name Constraints,
Key Usage, and Basic Constraints (pathlen).

If the  \fIhostname\fP provided is non\-NULL then this function will compare
the hostname in the certificate against it. The comparison will follow
the RFC6125 recommendations. If names do not match the
\fBGNUTLS_CERT_UNEXPECTED_OWNER\fP status flag will be set.

In order to verify the purpose of the end\-certificate (by checking the extended
key usage), use \fBgnutls_certificate_verify_peers()\fP.

To avoid denial of service attacks some
default upper limits regarding the certificate key size and chain
size are set. To override them use \fBgnutls_certificate_set_verify_limits()\fP.

Note that when using raw public\-keys verification will not work because there is
no corresponding certificate body belonging to the raw key that can be verified. In that
case this function will return \fBGNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) when the validation is performed, or a negative error code otherwise.
A successful error code means that the  \fIstatus\fP parameter must be checked to obtain the validation status.
.SH "SINCE"
3.1.4

.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crt_set_proxy_dn \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_set_proxy_dn(gnutls_x509_crt_t " crt ", gnutls_x509_crt_t " eecrt ", unsigned int " raw_flag ", const void * " name ", unsigned int " sizeof_name ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t crt" 12
a gnutls_x509_crt_t type with the new proxy cert
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t eecrt" 12
the end entity certificate that will be issuing the proxy
.IP "unsigned int raw_flag" 12
must be 0, or 1 if the CN is DER encoded
.IP "const void * name" 12
a pointer to the CN name, may be NULL (but MUST then be added later)
.IP "unsigned int sizeof_name" 12
holds the size of  \fIname\fP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will set the subject in  \fIcrt\fP to the end entity's
 \fIeecrt\fP subject name, and add a single Common Name component  \fIname\fP of size  \fIsizeof_name\fP .  This corresponds to the required proxy
certificate naming style.  Note that if  \fIname\fP is \fBNULL\fP, you MUST
set it later by using \fBgnutls_x509_crt_set_dn_by_oid()\fP or similar.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_pkcs12_t p12" 12
A pkcs12 type
.IP "const char * password" 12
optional password used to decrypt the structure, bags and keys.
.IP "gnutls_x509_privkey_t * key" 12
a structure to store the parsed private key.
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t ** chain" 12
the corresponding to key certificate chain (may be \fBNULL\fP)
.IP "unsigned int * chain_len" 12
will be updated with the number of additional (may be \fBNULL\fP)
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t ** extra_certs" 12
optional pointer to receive an array of additional
certificates found in the PKCS12 structure (may be \fBNULL\fP).
.IP "unsigned int * extra_certs_len" 12
will be updated with the number of additional
certs (may be \fBNULL\fP).
.IP "gnutls_x509_crl_t * crl" 12
an optional structure to store the parsed CRL (may be \fBNULL\fP).
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
should be zero or one of GNUTLS_PKCS12_SP_*
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function parses a PKCS12 structure in  \fIpkcs12\fP and extracts the
private key, the corresponding certificate chain, any additional
certificates and a CRL. The structures in  \fIkey\fP ,  \fIchain\fP  \fIcrl\fP , and  \fIextra_certs\fP must not be initialized.

The  \fIextra_certs\fP and  \fIextra_certs_len\fP parameters are optional
and both may be set to \fBNULL\fP. If either is non\-\fBNULL\fP, then both must
be set. The value for  \fIextra_certs\fP is allocated
using \fBgnutls_malloc()\fP.

Encrypted PKCS12 bags and PKCS8 private keys are supported, but
only with password based security and the same password for all
operations.

Note that a PKCS12 structure may contain many keys and/or certificates,
and there is no way to identify which key/certificate pair you want.
For this reason this function is useful for PKCS12 files that contain 
only one key/certificate pair and/or one CRL.

If the provided structure has encrypted fields but no password
is provided then this function returns \fBGNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED\fP.

Note that normally the chain constructed does not include self signed
certificates, to comply with TLS' requirements. If, however, the flag 
\fBGNUTLS_PKCS12_SP_INCLUDE_SELF_SIGNED\fP is specified then
self signed certificates will be included in the chain.

Prior to using this function the PKCS \fB12\fP structure integrity must
be verified using \fBgnutls_pkcs12_verify_mac()\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
.SH "SINCE"

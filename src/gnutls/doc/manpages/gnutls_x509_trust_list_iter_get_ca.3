.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_trust_list_iter_get_ca \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_trust_list_iter_get_ca(gnutls_x509_trust_list_t " list ", gnutls_x509_trust_list_iter_t * " iter ", gnutls_x509_crt_t * " crt ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_trust_list_t list" 12
The list
.IP "gnutls_x509_trust_list_iter_t * iter" 12
A pointer to an iterator (initially the iterator should be \fBNULL\fP)
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t * crt" 12
where the certificate will be copied
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function obtains a certificate in the trust list and advances the
iterator to the next certificate. The certificate returned in  \fIcrt\fP must be
deallocated with \fBgnutls_x509_crt_deinit()\fP.

When past the last element is accessed \fBGNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE\fP
is returned and the iterator is reset.

The iterator is deinitialized and reset to \fBNULL\fP automatically by this
function after iterating through all elements until
\fBGNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE\fP is returned. If the iteration is
aborted early, it must be manually deinitialized using
\fBgnutls_x509_trust_list_iter_deinit()\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
.SH "SINCE"
3.4.0

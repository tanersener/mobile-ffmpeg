.SH ARGUMENTS

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will convert the given PEM encoded certificate list
to the native gnutls_x509_crt_t format. The output will be stored
in  \fIcerts\fP .  They will be automatically initialized.

The flag \fBGNUTLS_X509_CRT_LIST_IMPORT_FAIL_IF_EXCEED\fP will cause
import to fail if the certificates in the provided buffer are more
than the available structures. The \fBGNUTLS_X509_CRT_LIST_FAIL_IF_UNSORTED\fP
flag will cause the function to fail if the provided list is not
sorted from subject to issuer.

If the Certificate is PEM encoded it should have a header of "X509
CERTIFICATE", or "CERTIFICATE".
.SH "RETURNS"
the number of certificates read or a negative error value.

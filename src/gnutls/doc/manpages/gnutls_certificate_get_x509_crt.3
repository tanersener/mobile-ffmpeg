.SH NAME
gnutls_certificate_get_x509_crt \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_certificate_get_x509_crt(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t " res ", unsigned " index ", gnutls_x509_crt_t ** " crt_list ", unsigned * " crt_list_size ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_certificate_credentials_t res" 12
is a \fBgnutls_certificate_credentials_t\fP type.
.IP "unsigned index" 12
The index of the certificate list to obtain.
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t ** crt_list" 12
Where to store the certificate list.
.IP "unsigned * crt_list_size" 12
Will hold the number of certificates.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Obtains a X.509 certificate list that has been stored in  \fIres\fP with one of
\fBgnutls_certificate_set_x509_key()\fP, \fBgnutls_certificate_set_key()\fP,
\fBgnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file()\fP,
\fBgnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file2()\fP,
\fBgnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_mem()\fP, or
\fBgnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_mem2()\fP. Each certificate in the returned
certificate list must be deallocated with \fBgnutls_x509_crt_deinit()\fP, and the
list itself must be freed with \fBgnutls_free()\fP.

The  \fIindex\fP matches the return value of \fBgnutls_certificate_set_x509_key()\fP and friends
functions, when the \fBGNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_API_V2\fP flag is set.

If there is no certificate with the given index,
\fBGNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE\fP is returned. If the certificate
with the given index is not a X.509 certificate, \fBGNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST\fP
is returned. The returned certificates must be deinitialized after
use, and the  \fIcrt_list\fP pointer must be freed using \fBgnutls_free()\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) on success, or a negative error code.
.SH "SINCE"
3.4.0
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"

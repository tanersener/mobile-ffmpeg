.SH NAME
gnutls_alert_send_appropriate \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_alert_send_appropriate(gnutls_session_t " session ", int " err ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP type.
.IP "int err" 12
is an error code returned by another GnuTLS function
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sends an alert to the peer depending on the error code returned by
a gnutls function. This function will call \fBgnutls_error_to_alert()\fP
to determine the appropriate alert to send.

This function may also return \fBGNUTLS_E_AGAIN\fP, or
\fBGNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED\fP.

This function historically was always sending an alert to the
peer, even if  \fIerr\fP was inappropriate to respond with an alert
(e.g., \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP). Since 3.6.6 this function returns
success without transmitting any data on error codes that
should not result to an alert.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise
an error code is returned.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bugs@gnutls.org>.

.SH NAME
gnutls_handshake \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_handshake(gnutls_session_t " session ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP type.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function performs the handshake of the TLS/SSL protocol, and
initializes the TLS session parameters.

The non\-fatal errors expected by this function are:
\fBGNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED\fP, \fBGNUTLS_E_AGAIN\fP, 
\fBGNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED\fP. When this function is called
for re\-handshake under TLS 1.2 or earlier, the non\-fatal error code
\fBGNUTLS_E_GOT_APPLICATION_DATA\fP may also be returned.

The former two interrupt the handshake procedure due to the transport
layer being interrupted, and the latter because of a "warning" alert that
was sent by the peer (it is always a good idea to check any
received alerts). On these non\-fatal errors call this function again,
until it returns 0; cf.  \fBgnutls_record_get_direction()\fP and
\fBgnutls_error_is_fatal()\fP. In DTLS sessions the non\-fatal error
\fBGNUTLS_E_LARGE_PACKET\fP is also possible, and indicates that
the MTU should be adjusted.

When this function is called by a server after a rehandshake request
under TLS 1.2 or earlier the \fBGNUTLS_E_GOT_APPLICATION_DATA\fP error code indicates
that some data were pending prior to peer initiating the handshake.
Under TLS 1.3 this function when called after a successful handshake, is a no\-op
and always succeeds in server side; in client side this function is
equivalent to \fBgnutls_session_key_update()\fP with \fBGNUTLS_KU_PEER\fP flag.

This function handles both full and abbreviated TLS handshakes (resumption).
For abbreviated handshakes, in client side, the \fBgnutls_session_set_data()\fP
should be called prior to this function to set parameters from a previous session.
In server side, resumption is handled by either setting a DB back\-end, or setting
up keys for session tickets.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on a successful handshake, otherwise a negative error code.

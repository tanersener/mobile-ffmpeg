.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_certificate_credentials_t cred" 12
is a \fBgnutls_certificate_credentials_t\fP type.
.IP "gnutls_certificate_verify_function * func" 12
is the callback function
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets a callback to be called when peer's certificate
has been received in order to verify it on receipt rather than
doing after the handshake is completed.

The callback's function prototype is:
int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t);

If the callback function is provided then gnutls will call it, in the
handshake, just after the certificate message has been received.
To verify or obtain the certificate the \fBgnutls_certificate_verify_peers2()\fP,
\fBgnutls_certificate_type_get()\fP, \fBgnutls_certificate_get_peers()\fP functions
can be used.

The callback function should return 0 for the handshake to continue
or non\-zero to terminate.

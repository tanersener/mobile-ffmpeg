.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crq_sign2 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crq_sign2(gnutls_x509_crq_t " crq ", gnutls_x509_privkey_t " key ", gnutls_digest_algorithm_t " dig ", unsigned int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crq_t crq" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_x509_crq_t\fP type
.IP "gnutls_x509_privkey_t key" 12
holds a private key
.IP "gnutls_digest_algorithm_t dig" 12
The message digest to use, i.e., \fBGNUTLS_DIG_SHA256\fP
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
must be 0
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will sign the certificate request with a private key.
This must be the same key as the one used in
\fBgnutls_x509_crt_set_key()\fP since a certificate request is self
signed.

This must be the last step in a certificate request generation
since all the previously set parameters are now signed.

A known limitation of this function is, that a newly\-signed request will not
be fully functional (e.g., for signature verification), until it
is exported an re\-imported.

After GnuTLS 3.6.1 the value of  \fIdig\fP may be \fBGNUTLS_DIG_UNKNOWN\fP,
and in that case, a suitable but reasonable for the key algorithm will be selected.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, otherwise a negative error code.
\fBGNUTLS_E_ASN1_VALUE_NOT_FOUND\fP is returned if you didn't set all
information in the certificate request (e.g., the version using
\fBgnutls_x509_crq_set_version()\fP).

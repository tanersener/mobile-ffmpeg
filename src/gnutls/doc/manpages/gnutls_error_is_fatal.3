.SH ARGUMENTS

is a GnuTLS error code, a negative error code
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If a GnuTLS function returns a negative error code you may feed that
value to this function to see if the error condition is fatal to
a TLS session (i.e., must be terminated).

Note that you may also want to check the error code manually, since some
non\-fatal errors to the protocol (such as a warning alert or
a rehandshake request) may be fatal for your program.

This function is only useful if you are dealing with errors from
functions that relate to a TLS session (e.g., record layer or handshake
layer handling functions).
.SH "RETURNS"
Non\-zero value on fatal errors or zero on non\-fatal.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"

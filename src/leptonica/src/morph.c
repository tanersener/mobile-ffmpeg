 *
 *  You are provided with many simple ways to do binary morphology.
 *  In particular, if you are using brick Sels, there are six
 *  convenient methods, all specially tailored for separable operations
 *  on brick Sels.  A "brick" Sel is a Sel that is a rectangle
 *  of solid SEL_HITs with the origin at or near the center.
 *  Note that a brick Sel can have one dimension of size 1.
 *  This is very common.  All the brick Sel operations are
 *  separable, meaning the operation is done first in the horizontal
 *  direction and then in the vertical direction.  If one of the
 *  dimensions is 1, this is a special case where the operation is
 *  only performed in the other direction.
 *
 *  These six brick Sel methods are enumerated as follows:
 *
 *  (1) Brick Sels: pix*Brick(), where * = {Dilate, Erode, Open, Close}.
 *      These are separable rasterop implementations.  The Sels are
 *      automatically generated, used, and destroyed at the end.
 *      You can get the result as a new Pix, in-place back into the src Pix,
 *      or written to another existing Pix.
 *
 *  (2) Brick Sels: pix*CompBrick(), where * = {Dilate, Erode, Open, Close}.
 *      These are separable, 2-way composite, rasterop implementations.
 *      The Sels are automatically generated, used, and destroyed at the end.
 *      You can get the result as a new Pix, in-place back into the src Pix,
 *      or written to another existing Pix.  For large Sels, these are
 *      considerably faster than the corresponding pix*Brick() functions.
 *      N.B.:  The size of the Sels that are actually used are typically
 *      close to, but not exactly equal to, the size input to the function.
 *
 *  (3) Brick Sels: pix*BrickDwa(), where * = {Dilate, Erode, Open, Close}.
 *      These are separable dwa (destination word accumulation)
 *      implementations.  They use auto-gen'd dwa code.  You can get
 *      the result as a new Pix, in-place back into the src Pix,
 *      or written to another existing Pix.  This is typically
 *      about 3x faster than the analogous rasterop pix*Brick()
 *      function, but it has the limitation that the Sel size must
 *      be less than 63.  This is pre-set to work on a number
 *      of pre-generated Sels.  If you want to use other Sels, the
 *      code can be auto-gen'd for them; see the instructions in morphdwa.c.
 *
 *  (4) Same as (1), but you run it through pixMorphSequence(), with
 *      the sequence string either compiled in or generated using snprintf.
 *      All intermediate images and Sels are created, used and destroyed.
 *      You always get the result as a new Pix.  For example, you can
 *      specify a separable 11 x 17 brick opening as "o11.17",
 *      or you can specify the horizontal and vertical operations
 *      explicitly as "o11.1 + o1.11".  See morphseq.c for details.
 *
 *  (5) Same as (2), but you run it through pixMorphCompSequence(), with
 *      the sequence string either compiled in or generated using snprintf.
 *      All intermediate images and Sels are created, used and destroyed.
 *      You always get the result as a new Pix.  See morphseq.c for details.
 *
 *  (6) Same as (3), but you run it through pixMorphSequenceDwa(), with
 *      the sequence string either compiled in or generated using snprintf.
 *      All intermediate images and Sels are created, used and destroyed.
 *      You always get the result as a new Pix.  See morphseq.c for details.
 *
 *  If you are using Sels that are not bricks, you have two choices:
 *      (a) simplest: use the basic rasterop implementations (pixDilate(), ...)
 *      (b) fastest: generate the destination word accumumlation (dwa)
 *          code for your Sels and compile it with the library.
 *
 *      For an example, see flipdetect.c, which gives implementations
 *      using hit-miss Sels with both the rasterop and dwa versions.
 *      For the latter, the dwa code resides in fliphmtgen.c, and it
 *      was generated by prog/flipselgen.c.  Both the rasterop and dwa
 *      implementations are tested by prog/fliptest.c.
 *
 *  A global constant MORPH_BC is used to set the boundary conditions
 *  for rasterop-based binary morphology.  MORPH_BC, in morph.c,
 *  is set by default to ASYMMETRIC_MORPH_BC for a non-symmetric
 *  convention for boundary pixels in dilation and erosion:
 *      All pixels outside the image are assumed to be OFF
 *      for both dilation and erosion.
 *  To use a symmetric definition, see comments in pixErode()
 *  and reset MORPH_BC to SYMMETRIC_MORPH_BC, using
 *  resetMorphBoundaryCondition().
 *
 *  Boundary artifacts are possible in closing when the non-symmetric
 *  boundary conditions are used, because foreground pixels very close
 *  to the edge can be removed.  This can be avoided by using either
 *  the symmetric boundary conditions or the function pixCloseSafe(),
 *  which adds a border before the operation and removes it afterwards.
 *
 *  The hit-miss transform (HMT) is the bit-and of 2 erosions:
 *     (erosion of the src by the hits)  &  (erosion of the bit-inverted
 *                                           src by the misses)
 *
 *  The 'generalized opening' is an HMT followed by a dilation that uses
 *  only the hits of the hit-miss Sel.
 *  The 'generalized closing' is a dilation (again, with the hits
 *  of a hit-miss Sel), followed by the HMT.
 *  Both of these 'generalized' functions are idempotent.
 *
 *  These functions are extensively tested in prog/binmorph1_reg.c,
 *  prog/binmorph2_reg.c, and prog/binmorph3_reg.c.

 * Notes:
 *      (1) Generic morphological closing, using hits in the Sel.
 *      (2) If non-symmetric boundary conditions are used, this
 *          function adds a border of OFF pixels that is of
 *          sufficient size to avoid losing pixels from the dilation,
 *          and it removes the border after the operation is finished.
 *          It thus enforces a correct extensive result for closing.
 *      (3) If symmetric b.c. are used, it is not necessary to add
 *          and remove this border.
 *      (4) There are three cases:
 *          (a) pixd == null   (result into new pixd)
 *          (b) pixd == pixs   (in-place; writes result back to pixs)
 *          (c) pixd != pixs   (puts result into existing pixd)
 *      (5) For clarity, if the case is known, use these patterns:
 *          (a) pixd = pixCloseSafe(NULL, pixs, ...);

 * <pre>
 * Notes:
 *      (1) Sel is a brick with all elements being hits
 *      (2) The origin is at (x, y) = (hsize/2, vsize/2)
 *      (3) Do compositely for each dimension > 1.
 *      (4) Do separably if both hsize and vsize are > 1.
 *      (5) There are three cases:
 *          (a) pixd == null   (result into new pixd)
 *          (b) pixd == pixs   (in-place; writes result back to pixs)
 *          (c) pixd != pixs   (puts result into existing pixd)
 *      (6) For clarity, if the case is known, use these patterns:
 *          (a) pixd = pixCloseCompBrick(NULL, pixs, ...);
 *          (b) pixCloseCompBrick(pixs, pixs, ...);
 *          (c) pixCloseCompBrick(pixd, pixs, ...);
 *      (7) The dimensions of the resulting image are determined by pixs.
 *      (8) CAUTION: both hsize and vsize are being decomposed.
 *          The decomposer chooses a product of sizes (call them
 *          'terms') for each that is close to the input size,
 *          but not necessarily equal to it.  It attempts to optimize:
 *             (a) for consistency with the input values: the product
 *                 of terms is close to the input size
 *             (b) for efficiency of the operation: the sum of the
 *                 terms is small; ideally about twice the square
 *                 root of the input size.
 *          So, for example, if the input hsize = 37, which is
 *          a prime number, the decomposer will break this into two
 *          terms, 6 and 6, so that the net result is a dilation
 *          with hsize = 36.

 *  Notes:
 *      (1) pixOtsuAdaptiveThreshold() computes a global threshold over each
 *          tile and performs the threshold operation, resulting in a
 *          binary image for each tile.  These are stitched into the
 *          final result.
 *      (2) pixOtsuThreshOnBackgroundNorm() and
 *          pixMaskedThreshOnBackgroundNorm() are binarization functions
 *          that use background normalization with other techniques.
 *      (3) Sauvola binarization computes a local threshold based on
 *          the local average and square average.  It takes two constants:
 *          the window size for the measurment at each pixel and a
 *          parameter that determines the amount of normalized local
 *          standard deviation to subtract from the local average value.
 *      (4) pixThresholdByCC() uses the numbers of 4 and 8 connected
 *          components at different thresholding to determine if a
 *          global threshold can be used (for text or line-art) and the
 *          value it should have.

 *
 * <pre>
 * Notes:
 *      (1) The Otsu method finds a single global threshold for an image.
 *          This function allows a locally adapted threshold to be
 *          found for each tile into which the image is broken up.
 *      (2) The array of threshold values, one for each tile, constitutes
 *          a highly downscaled image.  This array is optionally
 *          smoothed using a convolution.  The full width and height of the
 *          convolution kernel are (2 * %smoothx + 1) and (2 * %smoothy + 1).
 *      (3) The minimum tile dimension allowed is 16.  If such small
 *          tiles are used, it is recommended to use smoothing, because
 *          without smoothing, each small tile determines the splitting
 *          threshold independently.  A tile that is entirely in the
 *          image bg will then hallucinate fg, resulting in a very noisy
 *          binarization.  The smoothing should be large enough that no
 *          tile is only influenced by one type (fg or bg) of pixels,
 *          because it will force a split of its pixels.
 *      (4) To get a single global threshold for the entire image, use
 *          input values of %sx and %sy that are larger than the image.
 *          For this situation, the smoothing parameters are ignored.
 *      (5) The threshold values partition the image pixels into two classes:
 *          one whose values are less than the threshold and another
 *          whose values are greater than or equal to the threshold.
 *          This is the same use of 'threshold' as in pixThresholdToBinary().
 *      (6) The scorefract is the fraction of the maximum Otsu score, which
 *          is used to determine the range over which the histogram minimum
 *          is searched.  See numaSplitDistribution() for details on the
 *          underlying method of choosing a threshold.
 *      (7) This uses enables a modified version of the Otsu criterion for
 *          splitting the distribution of pixels in each tile into a
 *          fg and bg part.  The modification consists of searching for
 *          a minimum in the histogram over a range of pixel values where
 *          the Otsu score is within a defined fraction, %scorefract,
 *          of the max score.  To get the original Otsu algorithm, set
 *          %scorefract == 0.
 *      (8) N.B. This method is NOT recommended for images with weak text
 *          and significant background noise, such as bleedthrough, because
 *          of the problem noted in (3) above for tiling.  Use Sauvola.

 *
 * \param[in]    pixs 8 bpp grayscale, not colormapped
 * \param[in]    whsize window half-width for measuring local statistics
 * \param[in]    factor factor for reducing threshold due to variance; >= 0
 * \param[in]    nx, ny subdivision into tiles; >= 1
 * \param[out]   ppixth [optional] Sauvola threshold values
 * \param[out]   ppixd [optional] thresholded image
 * \return  0 if OK, 1 on error
 *
 * <pre>
 * Notes:
 *      (1) The window width and height are 2 * %whsize + 1.  The minimum
 *          value for %whsize is 2; typically it is >= 7..
 *      (2) For nx == ny == 1, this defaults to pixSauvolaBinarize().
 *      (3) Why a tiled version?
 *          (a) Because the mean value accumulator is a uint32, overflow
 *              can occur for an image with more than 16M pixels.
 *          (b) The mean value accumulator array for 16M pixels is 64 MB.
 *              The mean square accumulator array for 16M pixels is 128 MB.
 *              Using tiles reduces the size of these arrays.
 *          (c) Each tile can be processed independently, in parallel,
 *              on a multicore processor.
 *      (4) The Sauvola threshold is determined from the formula:
 *              t = m * (1 - k * (1 - s / 128))
 *          See pixSauvolaBinarize() for details.

 * Notes:
 *      (1) The window width and height are 2 * %whsize + 1.  The minimum
 *          value for %whsize is 2; typically it is >= 7..
 *      (2) The local statistics, measured over the window, are the
 *          average and standard deviation.
 *      (3) The measurements of the mean and standard deviation are
 *          performed inside a border of (%whsize + 1) pixels.  If pixs does
 *          not have these added border pixels, use %addborder = 1 to add
 *          it here; otherwise use %addborder = 0.
 *      (4) The Sauvola threshold is determined from the formula:
 *            t = m * (1 - k * (1 - s / 128))
 *          where:
 *            t = local threshold
 *            m = local mean
 *            k = %factor (>= 0)   [ typ. 0.35 ]
 *            s = local standard deviation, which is maximized at
 *                127.5 when half the samples are 0 and half are 255.
 *      (5) The basic idea of Niblack and Sauvola binarization is that
 *          the local threshold should be less than the median value,
 *          and the larger the variance, the closer to the median
 *          it should be chosen.  Typical values for k are between
 *          0.2 and 0.5.

 *            var == variance == expected square of deviation from mean
 *                == E(S(v - mv)) = E(S(v) - 2 * S(v * mv) + S(mv))

 * Notes:
 *      (1) This finds a global threshold based on connected components.
 *          Although slow, it is reasonable to use it in a situation where
 *          (a) the background in the image is relatively uniform, and
 *          (b) the result will be fed to an OCR program that accepts 1 bpp
 *              images and works best with easily segmented characters.
 *          The reason for (b) is that this selects a threshold with a
 *          minimum number of both broken characters and merged characters.
 *      (2) If the pix has color, it is converted to gray using the
 *          max component.
 *      (3) Input 0 to use default values for any of these inputs:
 *          %start, %end, %incr, %thresh48, %threshdiff.
 *      (4) This approach can be understood as follows.  When the
 *          binarization threshold is varied, the numbers of c.c. identify
 *          four regimes:
 *          (a) For low thresholds, text is broken into small pieces, and
 *              the number of c.c. is large, with the 4 c.c. significantly
 *              exceeding the 8 c.c.
 *          (b) As the threshold rises toward the optimum value, the text
 *              characters coalesce and there is very little difference
 *              between the numbers of 4 and 8 c.c, which both go
 *              through a minimum.
 *          (c) Above this, the image background gets noisy because some
 *              pixels are(thresholded to foreground, and the numbers
 *              of c.c. quickly increase, with the 4 c.c. significantly
 *              larger than the 8 c.c.
 *          (d) At even higher thresholds, the image background noise
 *              coalesces as it becomes mostly foreground, and the
 *              number of c.c. drops quickly.
 *      (5) If there is no global threshold that distinguishes foreground
 *          text from background (e.g., weak text over a background that
 *          has significant variation and/or bleedthrough), this returns 1,
 *          which the caller should check.

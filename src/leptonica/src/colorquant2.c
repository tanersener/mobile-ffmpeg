 *   Paul Heckbert published the median cut algorithm, "Color Image
 *   Quantization for Frame Buffer Display," in Proc. SIGGRAPH '82,
 *   Boston, July 1982, pp. 297-307.  See:
 *   http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/810000/801294/p297-heckbert.pdf
 *
 *   Median cut starts with either the full color space or the occupied
 *   region of color space.  If you're not dithering, the occupied region
 *   can be used, but with dithering, pixels can end up in any place
 *   in the color space, so you must represent the entire color space in
 *   the final colormap.
 *
 *   Color components are quantized to typically 5 or 6 significant
 *   bits (for each of r, g and b).   Call a 3D region of color
 *   space a 'vbox'.  Any color in this quantized space is represented
 *   by an element of a linear histogram array, indexed by rgb value.
 *   The initial region is then divided into two regions that have roughly
 *   equal pixel occupancy (hence the name "median cut").  Subdivision
 *   continues until the requisite number of vboxes has been generated.
 *
 *   But the devil is in the details of the subdivision process.
 *   Here are some choices that you must make:
 *     (1) Along which axis to subdivide?
 *     (2) Which box to put the bin with the median pixel?
 *     (3) How to order the boxes for subdivision?
 *     (4) How to adequately handle boxes with very small numbers of pixels?
 *     (5) How to prevent a little-represented but highly visible color
 *         from being masked out by other colors in its vbox.
 *
 *   Taking these in order:
 *     (1) Heckbert suggests using either the largest vbox side, or the vbox
 *         side with the largest variance in pixel occupancy.  We choose
 *         to divide based on the largest vbox side.
 *     (2) Suppose you've chosen a side.  Then you have a histogram
 *         of pixel occupancy in 2D slices of the vbox.  One of those
 *         slices includes the median pixel.  Suppose there are L bins
 *         to the left (smaller index) and R bins to the right.  Then
 *         this slice (or bin) should be assigned to the box containing
 *         the smaller of L and R.  This both shortens the larger
 *         of the subdivided dimensions and helps a low-count color
 *         far from the subdivision boundary to better express itself.
 *     (2a) One can also ask if the boundary should be moved even
 *         farther into the longer side.  This is feasible if we have
 *         a method for doing extra subdivisions on the high count
 *         vboxes.  And we do (see (3)).
 *     (3) To make sure that the boxes are subdivided toward equal
 *         occupancy, use an occupancy-sorted priority queue, rather
 *         than a simple queue.
 *     (4) With a priority queue, boxes with small number of pixels
 *         won't be repeatedly subdivided.  This is good.
 *     (5) Use of a priority queue allows tricks such as in (2a) to let
 *         small occupancy clusters be better expressed.  In addition,
 *         rather than splitting near the median, small occupancy colors
 *         are best reproduced by cutting half-way into the longer side.
 *
 *   However, serious problems can arise with dithering if a priority
 *   queue is used based on population alone.  If the picture has
 *   large regions of nearly constant color, some vboxes can be very
 *   large and have a sizeable population (but not big enough to get to
 *   the head of the queue).  If one of these large, occupied vboxes
 *   is near in color to a nearly constant color region of the
 *   image, dithering can inject pixels from the large vbox into
 *   the nearly uniform region.  These pixels can be very far away
 *   in color, and the oscillations are highly visible.  To prevent
 *   this, we can take either or both of these actions:
 *
 *     (1) Subdivide a fraction (< 1.0) based on population, and
 *         do the rest of the subdivision based on the product of
 *         the vbox volume and its population.  By using the product,
 *         we avoid further subdivision of nearly empty vboxes, and
 *         directly target large vboxes with significant population.
 *
 *     (2) Threshold the excess color transferred in dithering to
 *         neighboring pixels.
 *
 *   Doing either of these will stop the most annoying oscillations
 *   in dithering.  Furthermore, by doing (1), we also improve the
 *   rendering of regions of nearly constant color, both with and
 *   without dithering.  It turns out that the image quality is
 *   not sensitive to the value of the parameter in (1); values
 *   between 0.3 and 0.9 give very good results.
 *
 *   Here's the lesson: subdivide the color space into vboxes such
 *   that (1) the most populated vboxes that can be further
 *   subdivided (i.e., that occupy more than one quantum volume
 *   in color space) all have approximately the same population,
 *   and (2) all large vboxes have no significant population.
 *   If these conditions are met, the quantization will be excellent.
 *
 *   Once the subdivision has been made, the colormap is generated,
 *   with one color for each vbox and using the average color in the vbox.
 *   At the same time, the histogram array is converted to an inverse
 *   colormap table, storing the colormap index in every cell in the
 *   vbox.  Finally, using both the colormap and the inverse colormap,
 *   a colormapped pix is quickly generated from the original rgb pix.
 *
 *   In the present implementation, subdivided regions of colorspace
 *   that are not occupied are retained, but not further subdivided.
 *   This is required for our inverse colormap lookup table for
 *   dithering, because dithered pixels may fall into these unoccupied
 *   regions.  For such empty regions, we use the center as the rgb
 *   colormap value.
 *
 *   This variation on median cut can be referred to as "Modified Median
 *   Cut" quantization, or MMCQ.  Overall, the undithered MMCQ gives
 *   comparable results to the two-pass Octcube Quantizer (OQ).
 *   Comparing the two methods on the test24.jpg painting, we see:
 *
 *     (1) For rendering spot color (the various reds and pinks in
 *         the image), MMCQ is not as good as OQ.
 *
 *     (2) For rendering majority color regions, MMCQ does a better
 *         job of avoiding posterization.  That is, it does better
 *         dividing the color space up in the most heavily populated regions.

 * <pre>
 * Notes:
 *      (1) %maxcolors must be in the range [2 ... 256].
 *      (2) Use %outdepth = 0 to have the output depth computed as the
 *          minimum required to hold the actual colors found, given
 *          the %maxcolors constraint.
 *      (3) Use %outdepth = 1, 2, 4 or 8 to specify the output depth.
 *          In that case, %maxcolors must not exceed 2^(outdepth).
 *      (4) If there are fewer quantized colors in the image than %maxcolors,
 *          the colormap is simply generated from those colors.
 *      (5) %maxsub is the maximum allowed subsampling to be used in the
 *          computation of the color histogram and region of occupied
 *          color space.  The subsampling is chosen internally for
 *          efficiency, based on the image size, but this parameter
 *          limits it.  Use %maxsub = 0 for the internal default, which is the
 *          maximum allowed subsampling.  Use %maxsub = 1 to prevent
 *          subsampling.  In general use %maxsub >= 1 to specify the
 *          maximum subsampling to be allowed, where the actual subsampling
 *          will be the minimum of this value and the internally
 *          determined default value.
 *      (6) If the image appears gray because either most of the pixels
 *          are gray or most of the pixels are essentially black or white,
 *          the image is trivially quantized with a grayscale colormap.  The
 *          reason is that median cut divides the color space into rectangular
 *          regions, and it does a very poor job if all the pixels are
 *          near the diagonal of the color space cube.

 * <pre>
 * Notes:
 *      (1) ncolor + ngray must not exceed 255.
 *      (2) The method makes use of pixMedianCutQuantGeneral() with
 *          minimal addition.
 *          (a) Preprocess the image, setting all pixels with little color
 *              to black, and populating an auxiliary 8 bpp image with the
 *              expected colormap values corresponding to the set of
 *              quantized gray values.
 *          (b) Color quantize the altered input image to n + 1 colors.
 *          (c) Augment the colormap with the gray indices, and
 *              substitute the gray quantized values from the auxiliary
 *              image for those in the color quantized output that had
 *              been quantized as black.
 *      (3) Median cut color quantization is relatively poor for grayscale
 *          images with many colors, when compared to octcube quantization.
 *          Thus, for images with both gray and color, it is important
 *          to quantize the gray pixels by another method.  Here, we
 *          are conservative in detecting color, preferring to use
 *          a few extra bits to encode colorful pixels that push them
 *          to gray.  This is particularly reasonable with this function,
 *          because it handles the gray and color pixels separately,
 *          using median cut color quantization for the color pixels
 *          and equal-bin grayscale quantization for the non-color pixels.

 * Notes:
 *      (1) This is the "few colors" version of pixMedianCutQuantMixed().
 *          It fails (returns NULL) if it finds more than maxncolors, but
 *          otherwise it gives the same result.
 *      (2) Recommended input parameters are:
 *              %maxncolors:  20
 *              %darkthresh:  20
 *              %lightthresh: 244
 *              %diffthresh:  15  (any higher can miss colors differing
 *                                 slightly from gray)
 *      (3) Both ncolor and ngray should be at least equal to maxncolors.
 *          If they're not, they are automatically increased, and a
 *          warning is given.
 *      (4) If very little color content is found, the input is
 *          converted to gray and quantized in equal intervals.
 *      (5) This can be useful for quantizing orthographically generated
 *          images such as color maps, where there may be more than 256 colors
 *          because of aliasing or jpeg artifacts on text or lines, but
 *          there are a relatively small number of solid colors.
 *      (6) Example of usage:
 *             // Try to quantize, using default values for mixed med cut
 *             Pix *pixq = pixFewColorsMedianCutQuantMixed(pixs, 100, 20,
 *                             0, 0, 0, 0);
 *             if (!pixq)  // too many colors; don't quantize

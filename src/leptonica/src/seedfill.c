 *
 *           ITERATIVE RASTER-ORDER SEEDFILL
 *
 *      The basic method in the Vincent seedfill (aka reconstruction)
 *      algorithm is simple.  We describe here the situation for
 *      binary seedfill.  Pixels are sampled in raster order in
 *      the seed image.  If they are 4-connected to ON pixels
 *      either directly above or to the left, and are not masked
 *      out by the mask image, they are turned on (or remain on).
 *      (Ditto for 8-connected, except you need to check 3 pixels
 *      on the previous line as well as the pixel to the left
 *      on the current line.  This is extra computational work
 *      for relatively little gain, so it is preferable
 *      in most situations to use the 4-connected version.)
 *      The algorithm proceeds from UR to LL of the image, and
 *      then reverses and sweeps up from LL to UR.
 *      These double sweeps are iterated until there is no change.
 *      At this point, the seed has entirely filled the region it
 *      is allowed to, as delimited by the mask image.
 *
 *      The grayscale seedfill is a straightforward generalization
 *      of the binary seedfill, and is described in seedfillLowGray().
 *
 *      For some applications, the filled seed will later be OR'd
 *      with the negative of the mask.   This is used, for example,
 *      when you flood fill into a 4-connected region of OFF pixels
 *      and you want the result after those pixels are turned ON.
 *
 *      Note carefully that the mask we use delineates which pixels
 *      are allowed to be ON as the seed is filled.  We will call this
 *      a "filling mask".  As the seed expands, it is repeatedly
 *      ANDed with the filling mask: s & fm.  The process can equivalently
 *      be formulated using the inverse of the filling mask, which
 *      we will call a "blocking mask": bm = ~fm.   As the seed
 *      expands, the blocking mask is repeatedly used to prevent
 *      the seed from expanding into the blocking mask.  This is done
 *      by set subtracting the blocking mask from the expanded seed:
 *      s - bm.  Set subtraction of the blocking mask is equivalent
 *      to ANDing with the inverse of the blocking mask: s & (~bm).
 *      But from the inverse relation between blocking and filling
 *      masks, this is equal to s & fm, which proves the equivalence.
 *
 *      For efficiency, the pixels can be taken in larger units
 *      for processing, but still in raster order.  It is natural
 *      to take them in 32-bit words.  The outline of the work
 *      to be done for 4-cc (not including special cases for boundary
 *      words, such as the first line or the last word in each line)
 *      is as follows.  Let the filling mask be m.  The
 *      seed is to fill "under" the mask; i.e., limited by an AND
 *      with the mask.  Let the current word be w, the word
 *      in the line above be wa, and the previous word in the
 *      current line be wp.   Let t be a temporary word that
 *      is used in computation.  Note that masking is performed by
 *      w & m.  (If we had instead used a "blocking" mask, we
 *      would perform masking by the set subtraction operation,
 *      w - m, which is defined to be w & ~m.)
 *
 *      The entire operation can be implemented with shifts,
 *      logical operations and tests.  For each word in the seed image
 *      there are two steps.  The first step is to OR the word with
 *      the word above and with the rightmost pixel in wp (call it "x").
 *      Because wp is shifted one pixel to its right, "x" is ORed
 *      to the leftmost pixel of w.  We then clip to the ON pixels in
 *      the mask.  The result is
 *               t  <--  (w | wa | x000... ) & m
 *      We've now finished taking data from above and to the left.
 *      The second step is to allow filling to propagate horizontally
 *      in t, always making sure that it is properly masked at each
 *      step.  So if filling can be done (i.e., t is neither all 0s
 *      nor all 1s), iteratively take:
 *           t  <--  (t | (t >> 1) | (t << 1)) & m
 *      until t stops changing.  Then write t back into w.
 *
 *      Finally, the boundary conditions require we note that in doing
 *      the above steps:
 *          (a) The words in the first row have no wa
 *          (b) The first word in each row has no wp in that row
 *          (c) The last word in each row must be masked so that
 *              pixels don't propagate beyond the right edge of the
 *              actual image.  (This is easily accomplished by
 *              setting the out-of-bound pixels in m to OFF.)

 *          to a particular level, given by the maximum seed value
 *          in the basin.  Outside the filled region, the mask
 *          is above the filling level.
 *      (2) Contrast this with pixSeedfillGray(), where the clipping mask
 *          is always above or at the level of the fill.  An example
 *          of its use is the hdome fill, where the seed is an image
 *          where each pixel is a fixed amount smaller than the
 *          corresponding mask pixel.
 *      (3) The basin fill, pixSeedfillGrayBasin(), is a special case
 *          where the seed pixel values are generated from the mask,
 *          and where the implementation uses pixSeedfillGray() by
 *          inverting both the seed and mask.

/*!
 * \brief   seedfillGrayLow()
 *
 *  Notes:
 *      (1) The pixels are numbered as follows:
 *              1  2  3
 *              4  x  5
 *              6  7  8
 *          This low-level filling operation consists of two scans,
 *          raster and anti-raster, covering the entire seed image.
 *          This is followed by a breadth-first propagation operation to
 *          complete the fill.
 *          During the anti-raster scan, every pixel p whose current value
 *          could still be propagated after the anti-raster scan is put into
 *          the FIFO queue.
 *          The propagation step is a breadth-first fill to completion.
 *          Unlike the simple grayscale seedfill pixSeedfillGraySimple(),
 *          where at least two full raster/anti-raster iterations are required
 *          for completion and verification, the hybrid method uses only a
 *          single raster/anti-raster set of scans.
 *      (2) The filling action can be visualized from the following example.
 *          Suppose the mask, which clips the fill, is a sombrero-shaped
 *          surface, where the highest point is 200 and the low pixels
 *          around the rim are 30.  Beyond the rim, the mask goes up a bit.
 *          Suppose the seed, which is filled, consists of a single point
 *          of height 150, located below the max of the mask, with
 *          the rest 0.  Then in the raster scan, nothing happens until
 *          the high seed point is encountered, and then this value is
 *          propagated right and down, until it hits the side of the
 *          sombrero.   The seed can never exceed the mask, so it fills
 *          to the rim, going lower along the mask surface.  When it
 *          passes the rim, the seed continues to fill at the rim
 *          height to the edge of the seed image.  Then on the
 *          anti-raster scan, the seed fills flat inside the
 *          sombrero to the upper and left, and then out from the
 *          rim as before.  The final result has a seed that is
 *          flat outside the rim, and inside it fills the sombrero
 *          but only up to 150.  If the rim height varies, the
 *          filled seed outside the rim will be at the highest
 *          point on the rim, which is a saddle point on the rim.
 *      (3) Reference paper :

 * \brief   seedfillGrayInvLow()
 *
 *  Notes:
 *      (1) The pixels are numbered as follows:
 *              1  2  3
 *              4  x  5
 *              6  7  8
 *          This low-level filling operation consists of two scans,
 *          raster and anti-raster, covering the entire seed image.
 *          During the anti-raster scan, every pixel p such that its
 *          current value could still be propagated during the next
 *          raster scanning is put into the FIFO-queue.
 *          Next step is the propagation step where where we update
 *          and propagate the values using FIFO structure created in
 *          anti-raster scan.
 *      (2) The "Inv" signifies the fact that in this case, filling
 *          of the seed only takes place when the seed value is
 *          greater than the mask value.  The mask will act to stop
 *          the fill when it is higher than the seed level.  (This is
 *          in contrast to conventional grayscale filling where the
 *          seed always fills below the mask.)
 *      (3) An example of use is a basin, described by the mask (pixm),
 *          where within the basin, the seed pix (pixs) gets filled to the
 *          height of the highest seed pixel that is above its
 *          corresponding max pixel.  Filling occurs while the
 *          propagating seed pixels in pixs are larger than the
 *          corresponding mask values in pixm.
 *      (4) Reference paper :
 *            L. Vincent, Morphological grayscale reconstruction in image
 *            analysis: applications and efficient algorithms, IEEE Transactions
 *            on  Image Processing, vol. 2, no. 2, pp. 176-201, 1993.

/*!
 * \brief   seedfillGrayLowSimple()
 *
 *  Notes:
 *      (1) The pixels are numbered as follows:
 *              1  2  3
 *              4  x  5
 *              6  7  8
 *          This low-level filling operation consists of two scans,
 *          raster and anti-raster, covering the entire seed image.
 *          The caller typically iterates until the filling is
 *          complete.
 *      (2) The filling action can be visualized from the following example.
 *          Suppose the mask, which clips the fill, is a sombrero-shaped
 *          surface, where the highest point is 200 and the low pixels
 *          around the rim are 30.  Beyond the rim, the mask goes up a bit.
 *          Suppose the seed, which is filled, consists of a single point
 *          of height 150, located below the max of the mask, with
 *          the rest 0.  Then in the raster scan, nothing happens until
 *          the high seed point is encountered, and then this value is
 *          propagated right and down, until it hits the side of the
 *          sombrero.   The seed can never exceed the mask, so it fills
 *          to the rim, going lower along the mask surface.  When it
 *          passes the rim, the seed continues to fill at the rim
 *          height to the edge of the seed image.  Then on the
 *          anti-raster scan, the seed fills flat inside the
 *          sombrero to the upper and left, and then out from the
 *          rim as before.  The final result has a seed that is
 *          flat outside the rim, and inside it fills the sombrero
 *          but only up to 150.  If the rim height varies, the
 *          filled seed outside the rim will be at the highest
 *          point on the rim, which is a saddle point on the rim.

 * \brief   seedfillGrayInvLowSimple()
 *
 *  Notes:
 *      (1) The pixels are numbered as follows:
 *              1  2  3
 *              4  x  5
 *              6  7  8
 *          This low-level filling operation consists of two scans,
 *          raster and anti-raster, covering the entire seed image.
 *          The caller typically iterates until the filling is
 *          complete.
 *      (2) The "Inv" signifies the fact that in this case, filling
 *          of the seed only takes place when the seed value is
 *          greater than the mask value.  The mask will act to stop
 *          the fill when it is higher than the seed level.  (This is
 *          in contrast to conventional grayscale filling where the
 *          seed always fills below the mask.)
 *      (3) An example of use is a basin, described by the mask (pixm),
 *          where within the basin, the seed pix (pixs) gets filled to the
 *          height of the highest seed pixel that is above its
 *          corresponding max pixel.  Filling occurs while the
 *          propagating seed pixels in pixs are larger than the
 *          corresponding mask values in pixm.

 *      (1) This fills from a seed within basins defined by a filling mask.
 *          The seed value(s) are greater than the corresponding
 *          filling mask value, and the result has the bottoms of
 *          the basins raised by the initial seed value.
 *      (2) The seed has value 255 except where pixb has fg (1), which
 *          are the seed 'locations'.  At the seed locations, the seed
 *          value is the corresponding value of the mask pixel in pixm
 *          plus %delta.  If %delta == 0, we return a copy of pixm.
 *      (3) The actual filling is done using the standard grayscale filling
 *          operation on the inverse of the mask and using the inverse
 *          of the seed image.  After filling, we return the inverse of
 *          the filled seed.
 *      (4) As an example of use: pixm can describe a grayscale image
 *          of text, where the (dark) text pixels are basins of
 *          low values; pixb can identify the local minima in pixm (say, at
 *          the bottom of the basins); and delta is the amount that we wish
 *          to raise (lighten) the basins.  We construct the seed
 *          (a.k.a marker) image from pixb, pixm and %delta.

 * \return  pixd, or NULL on error
 *
 * <pre>
 * Notes:
 *      (1) This computes the distance of each pixel from the nearest
 *          background pixel.  All bg pixels therefore have a distance of 0,
 *          and the fg pixel distances increase linearly from 1 at the
 *          boundary.  It can also be used to compute the distance of
 *          each pixel from the nearest fg pixel, by inverting the input
 *          image before calling this function.  Then all fg pixels have
 *          a distance 0 and the bg pixel distances increase linearly
 *          from 1 at the boundary.
 *      (2) The algorithm, described in Leptonica on the page on seed
 *          filling and connected components, is due to Luc Vincent.
 *          In brief, we generate an 8 or 16 bpp image, initialized
 *          with the fg pixels of the input pix set to 1 and the
 *          1-boundary pixels (i.e., the boundary pixels of width 1 on
 *          the four sides set as either:
 *            * L_BOUNDARY_BG: 0
 *            * L_BOUNDARY_FG:  max
 *          where max = 0xff for 8 bpp and 0xffff for 16 bpp.
 *          Then do raster/anti-raster sweeps over all pixels interior
 *          to the 1-boundary, where the value of each new pixel is
 *          taken to be 1 more than the minimum of the previously-seen
 *          connected pixels (using either 4 or 8 connectivity).
 *          Finally, set the 1-boundary pixels using the mirrored method;
 *          this removes the max values there.
 *      (3) Using L_BOUNDARY_BG clamps the distance to 0 at the
 *          boundary.  Using L_BOUNDARY_FG allows the distance
 *          at the image boundary to "float".
 *      (4) For 4-connected, one could initialize only the left and top
 *          1-boundary pixels, and go all the way to the right
 *          and bottom; then coming back reset left and top.  But we
 *          instead use a method that works for both 4- and 8-connected.

 * \param[in]    connectivity   4 or 8
 * \return  pixd, or NULL on error
 *
 * <pre>
 * Notes:
 *      (1) The raster/anti-raster method for implementing this filling
 *          operation was suggested by Ray Smith.
 *      (2) This takes an arbitrary set of nonzero pixels in pixs, which
 *          can be sparse, and spreads (extrapolates) the values to
 *          fill all the pixels in pixd with the nonzero value it is
 *          closest to in pixs.  This is similar (though not completely
 *          equivalent) to doing a Voronoi tiling of the image, with a
 *          tile surrounding each pixel that has a nonzero value.
 *          All pixels within a tile are then closer to its "central"
 *          pixel than to any others.  Then assign the value of the
 *          "central" pixel to each pixel in the tile.
 *      (3) This is implemented by computing a distance function in parallel
 *          with the fill.  The distance function uses free boundary
 *          conditions (assumed maxval outside), and it controls the
 *          propagation of the pixels in pixd away from the nonzero
 *          (seed) values.  This is done in 2 traversals (raster/antiraster).
 *          In the raster direction, whenever the distance function
 *          is nonzero, the spread pixel takes on the value of its
 *          predecessor that has the minimum distance value.  In the
 *          antiraster direction, whenever the distance function is nonzero
 *          and its value is replaced by a smaller value, the spread
 *          pixel takes the value of the predecessor with the minimum
 *          distance value.
 *      (4) At boundaries where a pixel is equidistant from two
 *          nearest nonzero (seed) pixels, the decision of which value
 *          to use is arbitrary (greedy in search for minimum distance).
 *          This can give rise to strange-looking results, particularly
 *          for 4-connectivity where the L1 distance is computed from
 *          steps in N,S,E and W directions (no diagonals).

 * Notes:
 *      (1) This gives the actual local minima and maxima.
 *          A local minimum is a pixel whose surrounding pixels all
 *          have values at least as large, and likewise for a local
 *          maximum.  For the local minima, %maxmin is the upper
 *          bound for the value of pixs.  Likewise, for the local maxima,
 *          %minmax is the lower bound for the value of pixs.
 *      (2) The minima are found by starting with the erosion-and-equality
 *          approach of pixSelectedLocalExtrema().  This is followed
 *          by a qualification step, where each c.c. in the resulting
 *          minimum mask is extracted, the pixels bordering it are
 *          located, and they are queried.  If all of those pixels
 *          are larger than the value of that minimum, it is a true
 *          minimum and its c.c. is saved; otherwise the c.c. is
 *          rejected.  Note that if a bordering pixel has the
 *          same value as the minimum, it must then have a
 *          neighbor that is smaller, so the component is not a
 *          true minimum.
 *      (3) The maxima are found by inverting the image and looking
 *          for the minima there.
 *      (4) The generated masks can be used as markers for
 *          further operations.

 * Notes:
 *      (1) For each 8 connected component in pixm, this finds
 *          a pixel in pixs that has the lowest value, and saves
 *          it in a Pta.  If several pixels in pixs have the same
 *          minimum value, it picks the first one found.
 *      (2) For a mask pixm of true local minima, all pixels in each
 *          connected component have the same value in pixs, so it is
 *          fastest to select one of them using a special seedfill
 *          operation.  Not yet implemented.

 * Notes:
 *      (1) This removes each component in pixm for which there is
 *          at least one seed in pixs.  If pixd == NULL, this returns
 *          the result in a new pixd.  Otherwise, it is an in-place
 *          operation on pixm.  In no situation is pixs altered,
 *          because we do the filling with a copy of pixs.
 *      (2) If bordersize > 0, it also clears all pixels within a
 *          distance %bordersize of the edge of pixd.  This is here
 *          because pixLocalExtrema() typically finds local minima
 *          at the border.  Use %bordersize >= 2 to remove these.

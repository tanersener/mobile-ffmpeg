 *  See recogbasic.c for examples of training a recognizer, which is
 *  required before it can be used for document image decoding.
 *
 *  Gary Kopec pioneered this hidden markov approach to "Document Image
 *  Decoding" (DID) in the early 1990s.  It is based on estimation
 *  using a generative model of the image generation process, and
 *  provides the most likely decoding of an image if the model is correct.
 *  Given the model, it finds the maximum a posteriori (MAP) "message"
 *  given the observed image.  The model describes how to generate
 *  an image from a message, and the MAP message is derived from the
 *  observed image using Bayes' theorem.  This approach can also be used
 *  to build the model, using the iterative expectation/maximization
 *  method from labeled but errorful data.
 *
 *  In a little more detail: The model comprises three things: the ideal
 *  printed character templates, the independent bit-flip noise model, and
 *  the character setwidths.  When a character is printed, the setwidth
 *  is the distance in pixels that you move forward before being able
 *  to print the next character.  It is typically slightly less than the
 *  width of the character template: if too small, an extra character can be
 *  hallucinated; if too large, it will not be able to match the next
 *  character template on the line.  The model assumes that the probabilities
 *  of bit flip depend only on the assignment of the pixel to background
 *  or template foreground.  The multilevel templates have different
 *  bit flip probabilities for each level.  Because a character image
 *  is composed of many pixels, each of which can be independently flipped,
 *  the actual probability of seeing any rendering is exceedingly small,
 *  being composed of the product of the probabilities for each pixel.
 *  The log likelihood is used both to avoid numeric underflow and,
 *  more importantly, because it results in a summation of independent
 *  pixel probabilities.  That summation can be shown, in Kopec's
 *  original paper, to consist of a sum of two terms: (a) the number of
 *  fg pixels in the bit-and of the observed image with the ideal
 *  template and (b) the number of fg pixels in the template.  Each
 *  has a coefficient that depends only on the bit-flip probabilities
 *  for the fg and bg.  A beautiful result, and computationally simple!
 *  One nice feature of this approach is that the result of the decoding
 *  is not very sensitive to the values  used for the bit flip probabilities.
 *
 *  The procedure for finding the best decoding (MAP) for a given image goes
 *  under several names: Viterbi, dynamic programming, hidden markov model.
 *  It is called a "hidden markov model" because the templates are assumed
 *  to be printed serially and we don't know what they are -- the identity
 *  of the templates must be inferred from the observed image.
 *  The possible decodings form a dense trellis over the pixel positions,
 *  where at each pixel position you have the possibility of having any
 *  of the characters printed there (with some reference point) or having
 *  a single pixel wide space inserted there.  Thus, before the trellis
 *  can be traversed, we must do the work of finding the log probability,
 *  at each pixel location, that each of the templates was printed there.
 *  Armed with those arrays of data, the dynamic programming procedure
 *  moves from left to right, one pixel at a time, recursively finding
 *  the path with the highest log probability that gets to that pixel
 *  position (and noting which template was printed to arrive there).
 *  After reaching the right side of the image, we can simply backtrack
 *  along the path, jumping over each template that lies on the highest
 *  scoring path.  This best path thus only goes through a few of the
 *  pixel positions.
 *
 *  There are two refinements to the original Kopec paper.  In the first,
 *  one uses multiple, non-overlapping fg templates, each with its own
 *  bit flip probability.  This makes sense, because the probability
 *  that a fg boundary pixel flips to bg is greater than that of a fg
 *  pixel not on the boundary.  And the flip probability of a fg boundary
 *  pixel is smaller than that of a bg boundary pixel, which in turn
 *  is greater than that of a bg pixel not on a boundary (the latter
 *  is taken to be the true background).  Then the simplest realistic
 *  multiple template model has three templates that are not background.
 *
 *  In the second refinement, a heuristic (strict upper bound) is used
 *  iteratively in the Viterbi process to compute the log probabilities.
 *  Using the heuristic, you find the best path, and then score all nodes
 *  on that path with the actual probability, which is guaranteed to
 *  be a smaller number.  You run this iteratively, rescoring just the best
 *  found path each time.  After each rescoring, the path may change because
 *  the local scores have been reduced.  However, the process converges
 *  rapidly, and when it doesn't change, it must be the best path because
 *  it is properly scored (even if neighboring paths are heuristically
 *  scored).  The heuristic score is found column-wise by assuming
 *  that all the fg pixels in the template are on fg pixels in the image --
 *  we just take the minimum of the number of pixels in the template
 *  and image column.  This can easily give a 10-fold reduction in
 *  computation because the heuristic score can be computed much faster
 *  than the exact score.
 *
 *  For reference, the classic paper on the approach by Kopec is:
 *  * "Document Image Decoding Using Markov Source Models", IEEE Trans.
 *    PAMI, Vol 16, No. 6, June 1994, pp 602-617.

 *  What is a brick rank filter?
 *
 *    A brick rank order filter evaluates, for every pixel in the image,
 *    a rectangular set of n = wf x hf pixels in its neighborhood (where the
 *    pixel in question is at the "center" of the rectangle and is
 *    included in the evaluation).  It determines the value of the
 *    neighboring pixel that is the r-th smallest in the set,
 *    where r is some integer between 1 and n.  The input rank parameter
 *    is a fraction between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 represents the
 *    smallest value (r = 1) and 1.0 represents the largest value (r = n).
 *    A median filter is a rank filter where rank = 0.5.
 *
 *    It is important to note that grayscale erosion is equivalent
 *    to rank = 0.0, and grayscale dilation is equivalent to rank = 1.0.
 *    These are much easier to calculate than the general rank value,
 *    thanks to the van Herk/Gil-Werman algorithm:
 *       http://www.leptonica.com/grayscale-morphology.html
 *    so you should use pixErodeGray() and pixDilateGray() for
 *    rank 0.0 and 1.0, rsp.  See notes below in the function header.
 *
 *  How is a rank filter implemented efficiently on an image?
 *
 *    Sorting will not work.
 *
 *      * The best sort algorithms are O(n*logn), where n is the number
 *        of values to be sorted (the area of the filter).  For large
 *        filters this is an impractically large number.
 *
 *      * Selection of the rank value is O(n).  (To understand why it's not
 *        O(n*logn), see Numerical Recipes in C, 2nd edition, 1992,  p. 355ff).
 *        This also still far too much computation for large filters.
 *
 *      * Suppose we get clever.  We really only need to do an incremental
 *        selection or sorting, because, for example, moving the filter
 *        down by one pixel causes one filter width of pixels to be added
 *        and another to be removed.  Can we do this incrementally in
 *        an efficient way?  Unfortunately, no.  The sorted values will be
 *        in an array.  Even if the filter width is 1, we can expect to
 *        have to move O(n) pixels, because insertion and deletion can happen
 *        anywhere in the array.  By comparison, heapsort is excellent for
 *        incremental sorting, where the cost for insertion or deletion
 *        is O(logn), because the array itself doesn't need to
 *        be sorted into strictly increasing order.  However, heapsort
 *        only gives the max (or min) value, not the general rank value.
 *
 *    This leaves histograms.
 *
 *      * Represented as an array.  The problem with an array of 256
 *        bins is that, in general, a significant fraction of the
 *        entire histogram must be summed to find the rank value bin.
 *        Suppose the filter size is 5x5.  You spend most of your time
 *        adding zeroes.  Ouch!
 *
 *      * Represented as a linked list.  This would overcome the
 *        summing-over-empty-bin problem, but you lose random access
 *        for insertions and deletions.  No way.
 *
 *      * Two histogram solution.  Maintain two histograms with
 *        bin sizes of 1 and 16.  Proceed from coarse to fine.
 *        First locate the coarse bin for the given rank, of which
 *        there are only 16.  Then, in the 256 entry (fine) histogram,
 *        you need look at a maximum of 16 bins.  For each output
 *        pixel, the average number of bins summed over, both in the
 *        coarse and fine histograms, is thus 16.
 *
 *  If someone has a better method, please let me know!
 *
 *  The rank filtering operation is relatively expensive, compared to most
 *  of the other imaging operations.  The speed is only weakly dependent
 *  on the size of the rank filter.  On standard hardware, it runs at
 *  about 10 Mpix/sec for a 50 x 50 filter, and 25 Mpix/sec for
 *  a 5 x 5 filter.   For applications where the rank filter can be
 *  performed on a downscaled image, significant speedup can be
 *  achieved because the time goes as the square of the scaling factor.
 *  We provide an interface that handles the details, and only
 *  requires the amount of downscaling to be input.

 *  Examples of usage
 *  =================
 *
 *  See dewarpaCreateFromPixacomp() for an example of the basic
 *  operations, starting from a set of 1 bpp images.
 *
 *  Basic functioning to dewarp a specific single page:
 * \code
 *     // Make the Dewarpa for the pages
 *     L_Dewarpa *dewa = dewarpaCreate(1, 30, 1, 15, 50);
 *     dewarpaSetCurvatures(dewa, -1, 5, -1, -1, -1, -1);
 *     dewarpaUseBothArrays(dewa, 1);  // try to use both disparity
 *                                     // arrays for this example
 *
 *     // Do the page: start with a binarized image
 *     Pix *pixb = "binarize"(pixs);
 *     // Initialize a Dewarp for this page (say, page 214)
 *     L_Dewarp *dew = dewarpCreate(pixb, 214);
 *     // Insert in Dewarpa and obtain parameters for building the model
 *     dewarpaInsertDewarp(dewa, dew);
 *     // Do the work
 *     dewarpBuildPageModel(dew, NULL);  // no debugging
 *     // Optionally set rendering parameters
 *     // Apply model to the input pixs
 *     Pix *pixd;
 *     dewarpaApplyDisparity(dewa, 214, pixs, 255, 0, 0, &pixd, NULL);
 *     pixDestroy(&pixb);
 * \endcode
 *
 *  Basic functioning to dewarp many pages:
 * \code
 *     // Make the Dewarpa for the set of pages; use fullres 1 bpp
 *     L_Dewarpa *dewa = dewarpaCreate(10, 30, 1, 15, 50);
 *     // Optionally set rendering parameters
 *     dewarpaSetCurvatures(dewa, -1, 10, -1, -1, -1, -1);
 *     dewarpaUseBothArrays(dewa, 0);  // just use the vertical disparity
 *                                     // array for this example
 *
 *     // Do first page: start with a binarized image
 *     Pix *pixb = "binarize"(pixs);
 *     // Initialize a Dewarp for this page (say, page 1)
 *     L_Dewarp *dew = dewarpCreate(pixb, 1);
 *     // Insert in Dewarpa and obtain parameters for building the model
 *     dewarpaInsertDewarp(dewa, dew);
 *     // Do the work
 *     dewarpBuildPageModel(dew, NULL);  // no debugging
 *     dewarpMinimze(dew);  // remove most heap storage
 *     pixDestroy(&pixb);
 *
 *     // Do the other pages the same way
 *     ...
 *
 *     // Apply models to each page; if the page model is invalid,
 *     // try to use a valid neighboring model.  Note that the call
 *     // to dewarpaInsertRefModels() is optional, because it is called
 *     // by dewarpaApplyDisparity() on the first page it acts on.
 *     dewarpaInsertRefModels(dewa, 0, 1); // use debug flag to get more
 *                         // detailed information about the page models
 *     [For each page, where pixs is the fullres image to be dewarped] {
 *         L_Dewarp *dew = dewarpaGetDewarp(dewa, pageno);
 *         if (dew) {  // disparity model exists
 *             Pix *pixd;
 *             dewarpaApplyDisparity(dewa, pageno, pixs, 255,
 *                                   0, 0, &pixd, NULL);
 *             dewarpMinimize(dew);  // clean out the pix and fpix arrays
 *             // Squirrel pixd away somewhere ...)
 *         }
 *     }
 * \endcode
 *
 *  Basic functioning to dewarp a small set of pages, potentially
 *  using models from nearby pages:
 * \code
 *     // (1) Generate a set of binarized images in the vicinity of the
 *     // pages to be dewarped.  We will attempt to compute models
 *     // for pages from 'firstpage' to 'lastpage'.
 *     // Store the binarized images in a compressed array of
 *     // size 'n', where 'n' is the number of images to be stored,
 *     // and where the offset is the first page.
 *     PixaComp *pixac = pixacompCreateInitialized(n, firstpage, NULL,
 *                                                 IFF_TIFF_G4);
 *     for (i = firstpage; i <= lastpage; i++) {
 *         Pix *pixb = "binarize"(pixs);
 *         pixacompReplacePix(pixac, i, pixb, IFF_TIFF_G4);
 *         pixDestroy(&pixb);
 *     }
 *
 *     // (2) Make the Dewarpa for the pages.
 *     L_Dewarpa *dewa =
 *           dewarpaCreateFromPixacomp(pixac, 30, 15, 20);
 *     dewarpaUseBothArrays(dewa, 1);  // try to use both disparity arrays
 *                                     // in this example
 *
 *     // (3) Finally, apply the models.  For page 'firstpage' with image pixs:
 *     L_Dewarp *dew = dewarpaGetDewarp(dewa, firstpage);
 *     if (dew) {  // disparity model exists
 *         Pix *pixd;
 *         dewarpaApplyDisparity(dewa, firstpage, pixs, 255, 0, 0, &pixd, NULL);
 *         dewarpMinimize(dew);
 *     }
 * \endcode
 *
 *  Because in general some pages will not have enough text to build a
 *  model, we fill in for those pages with a reference to the page
 *  model to use.  Both the target page and the reference page must
 *  have the same parity.  We can also choose to use either a partial model
 *  (with only vertical disparity) or the full model of a nearby page.
 *
 *  Minimizing the data in a model by stripping out images,
 *  numas, and full resolution disparity arrays:
 *     dewarpMinimize(dew);
 *  This can be done at any time to save memory.  Serialization does
 *  not use the data that is stripped.
 *
 *  You can apply any model (in a dew), stripped or not, to another image:
 * \code
 *     // For all pages with invalid models, assign the nearest valid
 *     // page model with same parity.
 *     dewarpaInsertRefModels(dewa, 0, 0);
 *     // You can then apply to 'newpix' the page model that was assigned
 *     // to 'pageno', giving the result in pixd:
 *     Pix *pixd;
 *     dewarpaApplyDisparity(dewa, pageno, newpix, 255, 0, 0, &pixd, NULL);
 * \endcode
 *
 *  You can apply the disparity arrays to a deliberately undercropped
 *  image.  Suppose that you undercrop by (left, right, top, bot), so
 *  that the disparity arrays are aligned with their origin at (left, top).
 *  Dewarp the undercropped image with:
 * \code
 *     Pix *pixd;
 *     dewarpaApplyDisparity(dewa, pageno, undercropped_pix, 255,
 *                           left, top, &pixd, NULL);
 * \endcode
 *
 *  Description of the approach to analyzing page image distortion
 *  ==============================================================
 *
 *  When a book page is scanned, there are several possible causes
 *  for the text lines to appear to be curved:
 *   (1) A barrel (fish-eye) effect because the camera is at
 *       a finite distance from the page.  Take the normal from
 *       the camera to the page (the 'optic axis').  Lines on
 *       the page "below" this point will appear to curve upward
 *       (negative curvature); lines "above" this will curve downward.
 *   (2) Radial distortion from the camera lens.  Probably not
 *       a big factor.
 *   (3) Local curvature of the page in to (or out of) the image
 *       plane (which is perpendicular to the optic axis).
 *       This has no effect if the page is flat.
 *
 *  In the following, the optic axis is in the z direction and is
 *  perpendicular to the xy plane;, the book is assumed to be aligned
 *  so that y is approximately along the binding.
 *  The goal is to compute the "disparity" field, D(x,y), which
 *  is actually a vector composed of the horizontal and vertical
 *  disparity fields H(x,y) and V(x,y).  Each of these is a local
 *  function that gives the amount each point in the image is
 *  required to move in order to rectify the horizontal and vertical
 *  lines.  It would also be nice to "flatten" the page to compensate
 *  for effect (3), foreshortening due to bending of the page into
 *  the z direction, but that is more difficult.
 *
 *  Effects (1) and (2) can be directly compensated by calibrating
 *  the scene, using a flat page with horizontal and vertical lines.
 *  Then H(x,y) and V(x,y) can be found as two (non-parametric) arrays
 *  of values.  Suppose this has been done.  Then the remaining
 *  distortion is due to (3).
 *
 *  We consider the simple situation where the page bending is independent
 *  of y, and is described by alpha(x), where alpha is the angle between
 *  the normal to the page and the optic axis.  cos(alpha(x)) is the local
 *  compression factor of the page image in the horizontal direction, at x.
 *  Thus, if we know alpha(x), we can compute the disparity H(x) required
 *  to flatten the image by simply integrating 1/cos(alpha), and we could
 *  compute the remaining disparities, H(x,y) and V(x,y), from the
 *  page content, as described below.  Unfortunately, we don't know
 *  alpha.  What do we know?  If there are horizontal text lines
 *  on the page, we can compute the vertical disparity, V(x,y), which
 *  is the local translation required to make the text lines parallel
 *  to the rasters.  If the margins are left and right aligned, we can
 *  also estimate the horizontal disparity, H(x,y), required to have
 *  uniform margins.  All that can be done from the image alone,
 *  assuming we have text lines covering a sufficient part of the page.
 *
 *  What about alpha(x)?  The basic question relating to (3) is this:
 *
 *     Is it possible, using the shape of the text lines alone,
 *     to compute both the vertical and horizontal disparity fields?
 *
 *  The underlying problem is to separate the line curvature effects due
 *  to the camera view from those due to actual bending of the page.
 *  I believe the proper way to do this is to make some measurements
 *  based on the camera setup, which will depend mostly on the distance
 *  of the camera from the page, and to a smaller extent on the location
 *  of the optic axis with respect to the page.
 *
 *  Here is the procedure.  Photograph a page with a fine 2D line grid
 *  several times, each with a different slope near the binding.
 *  This can be done by placing the grid page on books that have
 *  different shapes z(x) near the binding.  For each one you can
 *  measure, near the binding:
 *    (1) ds/dy, the vertical rate of change of slope of the horizontal lines
 *    (2) the local horizontal compression of the vertical lines due
 *        to the page angle dz/dx.
 *  As mentioned above, the local horizontal compression is simply
 *  cos(dz/dx).  But the measurement you can make on an actual book
 *  page is (1).  The difficulty is to generate (2) from (1).
 *
 *  Back to the procedure.  The function in (1), ds/dy, likely needs
 *  to be measured at a few y locations, because the relation
 *  between (1) and (2) may weakly depend on the y-location with
 *  respect to the y-coordinate of the optic axis of the camera.
 *  From these measurements you can determine, for the camera setup
 *  that you have, the local horizontal compression, cos(dz/dx), as a
 *  function of the both vertical location (y) and your measured vertical
 *  derivative of the text line slope there, ds/dy.  Then with
 *  appropriate smoothing of your measured values, you can set up a
 *  horizontal disparity array to correct for the compression due
 *  to dz/dx.
 *
 *  Now consider V(x,0) and V(x,h), the vertical disparity along
 *  the top and bottom of the image.  With a little thought you
 *  can convince yourself that the local foreshortening,
 *  as a function of x, is proportional to the difference
 *  between the slope of V(x,0) and V(x,h).  The horizontal
 *  disparity can then be computed by integrating the local foreshortening
 *  over x.  Integration of the slope of V(x,0) and V(x,h) gives
 *  the vertical disparity itself.  We have to normalize to h, the
 *  height of the page.  So the very simple result is that
 *
 *      H(x) ~ (V(x,0) - V(x,h)) / h         [1]
 *
 *  which is easily computed.  There is a proportionality constant
 *  that depends on the ratio of h to the distance to the camera.
 *  Can we actually believe this for the case where the bending
 *  is independent of y?  I believe the answer is yes,
 *  as long as you first remove the apparent distortion due
 *  to the camera being at a finite distance.
 *
 *  If you know the intersection of the optical axis with the page
 *  and the distance to the camera, and if the page is perpendicular
 *  to the optic axis, you can compute the horizontal and vertical
 *  disparities due to (1) and (2) and remove them.  The resulting
 *  distortion should be entirely due to bending (3), for which
 *  the relation
 *
 *      Hx(x) dx = C * ((Vx(x,0) - Vx(x, h))/h) dx         [2]
 *
 *  holds for each point in x (Hx and Vx are partial derivatives w/rt x).
 *  Integrating over x, and using H(0) = 0, we get the result [1].
 *
 *  I believe this result holds differentially for each value of y, so
 *  that in the case where the bending is not independent of y,
 *  the expression (V(x,0) - V(x,h)) / h goes over to Vy(x,y).  Then
 *
 *     H(x,y) = Integral(0,x) (Vyx(x,y) dx)         [3]
 *
 *  where Vyx() is the partial derivative of V w/rt both x and y.
 *
 *  It would be nice if there were a simple mathematical relation between
 *  the horizontal and vertical disparities for the situation
 *  where the paper bends without stretching or kinking.
 *  I had hoped to get a relation between H and V, such as
 *  Hx(x,y) ~ Vy(x,y), which would imply that H and V are real
 *  and imaginary parts of a complex potential, each of which
 *  satisfy the laplace equation.  But then the gradients of the
 *  two potentials would be normal, and that does not appear to be the case.
 *  Thus, the questions of proving the relations above (for small bending),
 *  or finding a simpler relation between H and V than those equations,
 *  remain open.  So far, we have only used [1] for the horizontal
 *  disparity H(x).
 *
 *  In the version of the code that follows, we first use text lines
 *  to find V(x,y).  Then, we try to compute H(x,y) that will align
 *  the text vertically on the left and right margins.  This is not
 *  always possible -- sometimes the right margin is not right justified.
 *  By default, we don't require the horizontal disparity to have a
 *  valid page model for dewarping a page, but this requirement can
 *  be forced using dewarpaUseFullModel().
 *
 *  As described above, one can add a y-independent component of
 *  the horizontal disparity H(x) to counter the foreshortening
 *  effect due to the bending of the page near the binding.
 *  This requires widening the image on the side near the binding,
 *  and we do not provide this option here.  However, we do provide
 *  a function that will generate this disparity field:
 *       fpixExtraHorizDisparity()
 *
 *  Here is the basic outline for building the disparity arrays.
 *
 *  (1) Find lines going approximately through the center of the
 *      text in each text line.  Accept only lines that are
 *      close in length to the longest line.
 *  (2) Use these lines to generate a regular and highly subsampled
 *      vertical disparity field V(x,y).
 *  (3) Interpolate this to generate a full resolution vertical
 *      disparity field.
 *  (4) For lines that are sufficiently long, assume they are approximately
 *      left and right-justified, and construct a highly subsampled
 *      horizontal disparity field H(x,y) that will bring them into alignment.
 *  (5) Interpolate this to generate a full resolution horizontal
 *      disparity field.
 *  (6) Apply the vertical dewarping, followed by the horizontal dewarping.
 *
 *  Step (1) is clearly described by the code in pixGetTextlineCenters().
 *
 *  Steps (2) and (3) follow directly from the data in step (1),
 *  and constitute the bulk of the work done in dewarpBuildPageModel().
 *  Virtually all the noise in the data is smoothed out by doing
 *  least-square quadratic fits, first horizontally to the data
 *  points representing the text line centers, and then vertically.
 *  The trick is to sample these lines on a regular grid.
 *  First each horizontal line is sampled at equally spaced
 *  intervals horizontally.  We thus get a set of points,
 *  one in each line, that are vertically aligned, and
 *  the data we represent is the vertical distance of each point
 *  from the min or max value on the curve, depending on the
 *  sign of the curvature component.  Each of these vertically
 *  aligned sets of points constitutes a sampled vertical disparity,
 *  and we do a LS quartic fit to each of them, followed by
 *  vertical sampling at regular intervals.  We now have a subsampled
 *  grid of points, all equally spaced, giving at each point the local
 *  vertical disparity.  Finally, the full resolution vertical disparity
 *  is formed by interpolation.  All the least square fits do a
 *  great job of smoothing everything out, as can be observed by
 *  the contour maps that are generated for the vertical disparity field.

 *      (3) Use %redfactor = 1 for full resolution; 2 for 2x reduction.
 *          All input images must be at one of these two resolutions.

 *          small, so we multiply by 10^6 and express the constraints
 *          on the model curvatures in micro-units.
 *      (2) This sets five curvature thresholds and a slope threshold:
 *          * the maximum absolute value of the vertical disparity
 *            line curvatures
 *          * the minimum absolute value of the largest difference in
 *            vertical disparity line curvatures (Use a value of 0
 *            to accept all models.)
 *          * the maximum absolute value of the largest difference in
 *            vertical disparity line curvatures
 *          * the maximum absolute value of the left and right edge
 *            curvature for the horizontal disparity
 *          * the maximum absolute value of the difference between
 *            left and right edge curvature for the horizontal disparity
 *          all in micro-units, for dewarping to take place.
 *          Use -1 for default values.
 *      (3) An image with a line curvature less than about 0.00001
 *          has fairly straight textlines.  This is 10 micro-units.
 *      (4) For example, if %max_linecurv == 100, this would prevent dewarping
 *          if any of the lines has a curvature exceeding 100 micro-units.
 *          A model having maximum line curvature larger than about 150
 *          micro-units should probably not be used.

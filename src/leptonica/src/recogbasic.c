 *
 *  The recognizer functionality is split into four files:
 *    recogbasic.c: create, destroy, access, serialize
 *    recogtrain.c: training on labeled and unlabeled data
 *    recogident.c: running the recognizer(s) on input
 *    recogdid.c:   running the recognizer(s) on input using a
 *                  document image decoding (DID) hidden markov model
 *
 *  This is a content-adapted (or book-adapted) recognizer (BAR) application.
 *  The recognizers here are typically assembled from data that has
 *  been labeled by a generic recognition system, such as Tesseract.
 *  The general procedure to create a recognizer (recog) from labeled data is
 *  to add the labeled character bitmaps, either one at a time or
 *  all together from a pixa with labeled pix.
 *
 *  The suggested use for a BAR that consists of labeled templates drawn
 *  from a single source (e.g., a book) is to identify unlabeled samples
 *  by using unscaled character templates in the BAR, picking the
 *  template closest to the unlabeled sample.
 *
 *  Outliers can be removed from a pixa of labeled pix.  This is one of
 *  two methods that use averaged templates (the other is greedy splitting
 *  of characters).  See recogtrain.c for a discussion and the implementation.
 *
 *  A special bootstrap recognizer (BSR) can be used to make a BAR from
 *  unlabeled book data.  This is done by comparing character images
 *  from the book with labeled templates in the BSR, where all images
 *  are scaled to h = 40.  The templates can be either the scanned images
 *  or images consisting of width-normalized strokes derived from
 *  the skeleton of the character bitmaps.
 *
 *  Two BARs of labeled character data, that have been made by
 *  different recognizers, can be joined by extracting a pixa of the
 *  labeled templates from each, joining the two pixa, and then
 *  and regenerating a BAR from the joined set of templates.
 *  If all the labeled character data is from a single source (e.g, a book),
 *  identification can proceed using unscaled templates (either the input
 *  image or width-normalized lines).  But if the labeled data comes from
 *  more than one source, (a "hybrid" recognizer), the templates should
 *  be scaled, and we recommend scaling to a fixed height.
 *
 *  Suppose it is not possible to generate a BAR with a sufficient number
 *  of templates of each class taken from a single source.  In that case,
 *  templates from the BSR itself can be added.  This is the condition
 *  described above, where the labeled templates come from multiple
 *  sources, and it is necessary to do all character matches using
 *  templates that have been scaled to a fixed height (e.g., 40).
 *  Likewise, the samples to be identified using this hybrid recognizer
 *  must be modified in the same way.  See prog/recogtest3.c for an
 *  example of the steps that can be taken in the construction of a BAR
 *  using a BSR.
 *
 *  For training numeric input, an example set of calls that scales
 *  each training input to fixed h and will use the line templates of
 *  width linew for identifying unknown characters is:
 *         L_Recog  *rec = recogCreate(0, h, linew, 128, 1);
 *         for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {  // read in n training digits
 *             Pix *pix = ...
 *             recogTrainLabeled(rec, pix, NULL, text[i], 0);
 *         }
 *         recogTrainingFinished(&rec, 1, -1, -1.0);  // required
 *
 *  It is an error if any function that computes averages, removes
 *  outliers or requests identification of an unlabeled character,
 *  such as:
 *     (1) computing the sample averages: recogAverageSamples()
 *     (2) removing outliers: recogRemoveOutliers1() or recogRemoveOutliers2()
 *     (3) requesting identification of an unlabeled character:
 *         recogIdentifyPix()
 *  is called before an explicit call to finish training.  Note that
 *  to do further training on a "finished" recognizer, you can set
 *         recog->train_done = FALSE;
 *  add the new training samples, and again call
 *         recogTrainingFinished(&rec, 1, -1, -1.0);  // required
 *
 *  If not scaling, using the images directly for identification, and
 *  removing outliers, do something like this:
 *      L_Recog  *rec = recogCreate(0, 0, 0, 128, 1);
 *      for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {  // read in n training characters
 *          Pix *pix = ...
 *          recogTrainLabeled(rec, pix, NULL, text[i], 0);
 *      }
 *      recogTrainingFinished(&rec, 1, -1, -1.0);
 *      if (!rec) ... [return]
 *      // remove outliers
 *      recogRemoveOutliers1(&rec, 0.7, 2, NULL, NULL);
 *
 *  You can generate a recognizer from a pixa where the text field in
 *  each pix is the character string label for the pix.  For example,
 *  the following recognizer will store unscaled line images:
 *      L_Recog  *rec = recogCreateFromPixa(pixa, 0, 0, linew, 128, 1);
 *  and in use, it is fed unscaled line images to identify.
 *
 *  For the following, assume that you have a pixa of labeled templates.
 *  If it is likely that some of the input templates are mislabeled,
 *  there are several things that can be done to remove them.
 *  The first is to put a size and quantity filter on them; e.g.
 *       Pixa *pixa2 = recogFilterPixaBySize(pixa1, 10, 15, 2.6);
 *  Then you can remove outliers; e.g.,
 *       Pixa *pixa3 = pixaRemoveOutliers2(pixa2, -1.0, -1, NULL, NULL);
 *
 *  To this point, all templates are from a single source, so you
 *  can make a recognizer that uses the unscaled templates and optionally
 *  attempts to split touching characters:
 *       L_Recog *recog1 = recogCreateFromPixa(pixa3, ...);
 *  Alternatively, if you need more templates for some of the classes,
 *  you can pad with templates from a "bootstrap" recognizer (BSR).
 *  If you pad, it is necessary to scale the templates and input
 *  samples to a fixed height, and no attempt will be made to split
 *  the input sample connected components:
 *       L_Recog *recog1 = recogCreateFromPixa(pixa3, 0, 40, 0, 128, 0);
 *       recogPadDigitTrainingSet(&recog1, 40, 0);
 *
 *  A special case is a pure BSR, that contains images scaled to a fixed
 *  height (we use 40 in these examples).
 *  For this,use either the scanned bitmap:
 *      L_Recog  *recboot = recogCreateFromPixa(pixa, 0, 40, 0, 128, 1);
 *  or width-normalized lines (use width of 5 here):
 *      L_Recog  *recboot = recogCreateFromPixa(pixa, 0, 40, 5, 128, 1);
 *
 *  This can be used to train a new book adapted recognizer (BAC), on
 *  unlabeled data from, e.g., a book.  To do this, the following is required:
 *   (1) the input images from the book must be scaled in the same
 *       way as those in the BSR, and
 *   (2) both the BSR and the input images must be set up to be either
 *       input scanned images or width-normalized lines.

 *          of the recog.  These can be different from the templates that

 *          can be scaled and turned into normalized lines.  When recog1
 *          is deserialized to recog2, these templates are put in both the
 *          unscaled array (pixaa_u) and the modified array (pixaa) in recog2.
 *          Why not put it in only the unscaled array and let
 *          recogTrainingFinalized() regenerate the modified templates?
 *          The reason is that with normalized lines, the operation of
 *          thinning to a skeleton and dilating back to a fixed width
 *          is not idempotent.  Thinning to a skeleton saves pixels at
 *          the end of a line segment, and thickening the skeleton puts
 *          additional pixels at the end of the lines.  This tends to
 *          close gaps.

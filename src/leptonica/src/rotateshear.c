 *      Shear rotation about arbitrary point using 2 and 3 shears

 *      Shear rotation in-place about arbitrary point using 3 shears
 *              l_int32   pixRotateShearIP()
 *
 *      Shear rotation around the image center
 *              PIX      *pixRotateShearCenter()    (2 or 3 shears)
 *              l_int32   pixRotateShearCenterIP()  (3 shears)
 *
 *  Rotation is measured in radians; clockwise rotations are positive.
 *
 *  Rotation by shear works on images of any depth,
 *  including 8 bpp color paletted images and 32 bpp
 *  rgb images.  It works by translating each src pixel
 *  value to the appropriate pixel in the rotated dest.
 *  For 8 bpp grayscale images, it is about 10-15x faster
 *  than rotation by area-mapping.
 *
 *  This speed and flexibility comes at the following cost,
 *  relative to area-mapped rotation:
 *
 *    ~  Jaggies are created on edges of straight lines
 *
 *    ~  For large angles, where you must use 3 shears,
 *       there is some extra clipping from the shears.
 *
 *  For small angles, typically less than 0.05 radians,
 *  rotation can be done with 2 orthogonal shears.
 *  Two such continuous shears (as opposed to the discrete
 *  shears on a pixel lattice that we have here) give
 *  a rotated image that has a distortion in the lengths
 *  of the two rotated and still-perpendicular axes.  The
 *  length/width ratio changes by a fraction
 *
 *       0.5 * (angle)**2
 *
 *  For an angle of 0.05 radians, this is about 1 part in
 *  a thousand.  This distortion is absent when you use
 *  3 continuous shears with the correct angles (see below).
 *
 *  Of course, the image is on a discrete pixel lattice.
 *  Rotation by shear gives an approximation to a continuous
 *  rotation, leaving pixel jaggies at sharp boundaries.
 *  For very small rotations, rotating from a corner gives
 *  better sensitivity than rotating from the image center.
 *  Here's why.  Define the shear "center" to be the line such
 *  that the image is sheared in opposite directions on
 *  each side of and parallel to the line.  For small
 *  rotations there is a "dead space" on each side of the
 *  shear center of width equal to half the shear angle,
 *  in radians.  Thus, when the image is sheared about the center,
 *  the dead space width equals the shear angle, but when
 *  the image is sheared from a corner, the dead space
 *  width is only half the shear angle.
 *
 *  All horizontal and vertical shears are implemented by
 *  rasterop.  The in-place rotation uses special in-place
 *  shears that copy rows sideways or columns vertically
 *  without buffering, and then rewrite old pixels that are
 *  no longer covered by sheared pixels.  For that rewriting,
 *  you have the choice of using white or black pixels.
 *  (Note that this may give undesirable results for colormapped
 *  images, where the white and black values are arbitrary
 *  indexes into the colormap, and may not even exist.)
 *
 *  Rotation by shear is fast and depth-independent.  However, it
 *  does not work well for large rotation angles.  In fact, for
 *  rotation angles greater than about 7 degrees, more pixels are
 *  lost at the edges than when using pixRotationBySampling(), which
 *  only loses pixels because they are rotated out of the image.
 *  For larger rotations, use pixRotationBySampling() or, for
 *  more accuracy when d > 1 bpp, pixRotateAM().
 *
 *  For small angles, when comparing the quality of rotation by
 *  sampling and by shear, you can see that rotation by sampling
 *  is slightly more accurate.  However, the difference in
 *  accuracy of rotation by sampling when compared to 3-shear and
 *  (for angles less than 2 degrees, when compared to 2-shear) is
 *  less than 1 pixel at any point.  For very small angles, rotation by
 *  sampling is much slower than rotation by shear.  The speed difference
 *  depends on the pixel depth and the rotation angle.  Rotation
 *  by shear is very fast for small angles and for small depth (esp. 1 bpp).
 *  Rotation by sampling speed is independent of angle and relatively
 *  more efficient for 8 and 32 bpp images.  Here are some timings
 *  for the ratio of rotation times: (time for sampling)/ (time for shear)
  *
 *       depth (bpp)       ratio (2 deg)       ratio (10 deg)
 *       -----------------------------------------------------
 *          1                  25                  6
 *          8                   5                  2.6
 *          32                  1.6                1.0
 *
 *  In summary:
 *    * For d == 1 and small angles, use rotation by shear.  By default
 *      this will use 2-shear rotations, because 3-shears cause more
 *      visible artifacts in straight lines and, for small angles, the
 *      distortion in asperity ratio is small.
 *    * For d > 1, shear is faster than sampling, which is faster than
 *      area mapping.  However, area mapping gives the best results.
 *  These results are used in selecting the rotation methods in
 *  pixRotateShear().
 *
 *  There has been some work on what is called a "quasishear
 *  rotation" ("The Quasi-Shear Rotation, Eric Andres,
 *  DGCI 1996, pp. 307-314).  I believe they use a 3-shear
 *  approximation to the continuous rotation, exactly as
 *  we do here.  The approximation is due to being on
 *  a square pixel lattice.  They also use integers to specify
 *  the rotation angle and center offset, but that makes
 *  little sense on a machine where you have a few GFLOPS
 *  and only a few hundred floating point operations to do (!)
 *  They also allow subpixel specification of the center of
 *  rotation, which I haven't bothered with, and claim that
 *  better results are possible if each of the 4 quadrants is
 *  handled separately.
 *
 *  But the bottom line is that you are going to see shear lines when
 *  you rotate 1 bpp images.  Although the 3-shear rotation is
 *  mathematically exact in the limit of infinitesimal pixels, artifacts
 *  will be evident in real images.  One might imagine using dithering
 *  to break up the horizontal and vertical shear lines, but this
 *  is hard with block shears, where you need to dither on the block
 *  boundaries.  Dithering (by accumulation of 'error') with sampling
 *  makes more sense, but I haven't tried to do this.  There is only
 *  so much you can do with 1 bpp images!

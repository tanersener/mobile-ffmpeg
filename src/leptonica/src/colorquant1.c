/*
 * <pre>
 *   This data structure is used for pixOctreeColorQuant(),
 *   a color octree that adjusts to the color distribution
 *   in the image that is being quantized.  The best settings
 *   are with CQ_NLEVELS = 6 and DITHERING set on.
 *
 * Notes:
 *      (1) the CTE (color table entry) index is sequentially
 *          assigned as the tree is pruned back
 *      (2) if 'bleaf' == 1, all pixels in that cube have been
 *          assigned to one or more CTEs.  But note that if
 *          all 8 subcubes have 'bleaf' == 1, it will have no
 *          pixels left for assignment and will not be a CTE.
 *      (3) 'nleaves', the number of leaves contained at the next
 *          lower level is some number between 0 and 8, inclusive.
 *          If it is zero, it means that all colors within this cube
 *          are part of a single growing cluster that has not yet
 *          been set aside as a leaf.  If 'nleaves' > 0, 'bleaf'
 *          will be set to 1 and all pixels not assigned to leaves
 *          at lower levels will be assigned to a CTE here.
 *          (However, as described above, if all pixels are already
 *          assigned, we set 'bleaf' = 1 but do not create a CTE
 *          at this level.)
 *      (4) To keep the maximum color error to a minimum, we
 *          prune the tree back to level 2, and require that
 *          all 64 level 2 cells are CTEs.
 *      (5) We reserve an extra set of colors to prevent running out
 *          of colors during the assignment of the final 64 level 2 cells.
 *          This is more likely to happen with small images.
 *      (6) When we run out of colors, the dithered image can be very
 *          poor, so we additionally prevent dithering if the image
 *          is small.
 *      (7) The color content of the image is measured, and if there
 *          is very little color, it is quantized in grayscale.

 *
 * <pre>
 *  I found one description in the literature of octree color
 *  quantization, using progressive truncation of the octree,
 *  by M. Gervautz and W. Purgathofer in Graphics Gems, pp.
 *  287-293, ed. A. Glassner, Academic Press, 1990.
 *  Rather than setting up a fixed partitioning of the color
 *  space ab initio, as we do here, they allow the octree to be
 *  progressively truncated as new pixels are added.  They
 *  need to set up some data structures that are traversed
 *  with the addition of each 24 bit pixel, in order to decide
 *  either 1) in which cluster (sub-branch of the octree to put
 *  the pixel, or 2 whether to truncate the octree further
 *  to place the pixel in an existing cluster, or 3 which
 *  two existing clusters should be merged so that the pixel
 *  can be left to start a truncated leaf of the octree.  Such dynamic
 *  truncation is considerably more complicated, and Gervautz et
 *  al. did not explain how they did it in anywhere near the
 *  detail required to check their implementation.
 *
 *  The simple method in pixFixedOctcubeQuant256 is very
 *  fast, and with dithering the results are good, but you
 *  can do better if the color clusters are selected adaptively
 *  from the image.  We want a method that makes much better
 *  use of color samples in regions of color space with high
 *  pixel density, while also fairly representing small numbers
 *  of color pixels in low density regions.  Such adaptation
 *  requires two passes through the image: the first for generating
 *  the pruned tree of color cubes and the second for computing the index
 *  into the color table for each pixel.
 *
 *  A relatively simple adaptive method is pixOctreeQuantByPopulation.
 *  That function first determines if the image has very few colors,
 *  and, if so, quantizes to those colors.  If there are more than
 *  256 colors, it generates a histogram of octcube leaf occupancy
 *  at level 4, chooses the 192 most populated such leaves as
 *  the first 192 colors, and sets the remaining 64 colors to the
 *  residual average pixel values in each of the 64 level 2 octcubes.
 *  This is a bit faster than pixOctreeColorQuant, and does very
 *  well without dithering, but for most images with dithering it
 *  is clearly inferior.
 *
 *  We now describe pixOctreeColorQuant.  The first pass is done
 *  on a subsampled image, because we do not need to use all the
 *  pixels in the image to generate the tree.  Subsampling
 *  down to 0.25 1/16 of the pixels makes the program run
 *  about 1.3 times faster.
 *
 *  Instead of dividing the color space into 256 equal-sized
 *  regions, we initially divide it into 2^12 or 2^15 or 2^18
 *  equal-sized octcubes.  Suppose we choose to use 2^18 octcubes.
 *  This gives us 6 octree levels.  We then prune back,
 *  starting from level 6.  For every cube at level 6, there
 *  are 8 cubes at level 5.  Call the operation of putting a
 *  cube aside as a color table entry CTE a "saving."
 *  We use a in general level-dependent threshold, and save
 *  those level 6 cubes that are above threshold.
 *  The rest are combined into the containing level 5 cube.
 *  If between 1 and 7 level 6 cubes within a level 5
 *  cube have been saved by thresholding, then the remaining
 *  level 6 cubes in that level 5 cube are automatically
 *  saved as well, without applying a threshold.  This greatly
 *  simplifies both the description of the CTEs and the later
 *  classification of each pixel as belonging to a CTE.
 *  This procedure is iterated through every cube, starting at
 *  level 5, and then 4, 3, and 2, successively.  The result is that
 *  each CTE contains the entirety of a set of from 1 to 7 cubes
 *  from a given level that all belong to a single cube at the
 *  level above.   We classify the CTEs in terms of the
 *  condition in which they are made as either being "threshold"
 *  or "residual."  They are "threshold" CTEs if no subcubes
 *  are CTEs that is, they contain every pixel within the cube
 *  and the number of pixels exceeds the threshold for making
 *  a CTE.  They are "residual" CTEs if at least one but not more
 *  than 7 of the subcubes have already been determined to be CTEs;
 *  this happens automatically -- no threshold is applied.
 *  If all 8 subcubes are determined to be CTEs, the cube is
 *  marked as having all pixels accounted for 'bleaf' = 1 but
 *  is not saved as a CTE.
 *
 *  We stop the pruning at level 2, at which there are 64
 *  sub-cubes.  Any pixels not already claimed in a CTE are
 *  put in these cubes.
 *
 *  As the cubes are saved as color samples in the color table,
 *  the number of remaining pixels P and the number of
 *  remaining colors in the color table N are recomputed,
 *  along with the average number of pixels P/N ppc to go in
 *  each of the remaining colors.  This running average number is
 *  used to set the threshold at the current level.
 *
 *  Because we are going to very small cubes at levels 6 or 5,
 *  and will dither the colors for errors, it is not necessary
 *  to compute the color center of each cluster; we can simply
 *  use the center of the cube.  This gives us a minimax error
 *  condition: the maximum error is half the width of the
 *  level 2 cubes -- 32 color values out of 256 -- for each color
 *  sample.  In practice, most of the pixels will be very much
 *  closer to the center of their cells.  And with dithering,
 *  the average pixel color in a small region will be closer still.
 *  Thus with the octree quantizer, we are able to capture
 *  regions of high color pdf probability density function in small
 *  but accurate CTEs, and to have only a small number of pixels
 *  that end up a significant distance with a guaranteed maximum
 *  from their true color.
 *
 *  How should the threshold factor vary?  Threshold factors
 *  are required for levels 2, 3, 4 and 5 in the pruning stage.
 *  The threshold for level 5 is actually applied to cubes at
 *  level 6, etc.  From various experiments, it appears that
 *  the results do not vary appreciably for threshold values near 1.0.
 *  If you want more colors in smaller cubes, the threshold
 *  factors can be set lower than 1.0 for cubes at levels 4 and 5.
 *  However, if the factor is set much lower than 1.0 for
 *  levels 2 and 3, we can easily run out of colors.
 *  We put aside 64 colors in the calculation of the threshold
 *  values, because we must have 64 color centers at level 2,
 *  that will have very few pixels in most of them.
 *  If we reduce the factor for level 5 to 0.4, this will
 *  generate many level 6 CTEs, and consequently
 *  many residual cells will be formed up from those leaves,
 *  resulting in the possibility of running out of colors.
 *  Remember, the residual CTEs are mandatory, and are formed
 *  without using the threshold, regardless of the number of
 *  pixels that are absorbed.
 *
 *  The implementation logically has four parts:
 *
 *       1 accumulation into small, fixed cells
 *       2 pruning back into selected CTE cubes
 *       3 organizing the CTEs for fast search to find
 *           the CTE to which any image pixel belongs
 *       4 doing a second scan to code the image pixels by CTE
 *
 *  Step 1 is straightforward; we use 2^15 cells.
 *
 *  We've already discussed how the pruning step 2 will be performed.
 *
 *  Steps 3) and (4 are related, in that the organization
 *  used by step 3 determines how the search actually
 *  takes place for each pixel in step 4.
 *
 *  There are many ways to do step 3.  Let's explore a few.
 *
 *  a The simplest is to order the cubes from highest occupancy
 *      to lowest, and traverse the list looking for the deepest
 *      match.  To make this more efficient, so that we know when
 *      to stop looking, any cube that has separate CTE subcubes
 *      would be marked as such, so that we know when we hit a
 *      true leaf.
 *
 *  b Alternatively, we can order the cubes by highest
 *      occupancy separately each level, and work upward,
 *      starting at level 5, so that when we find a match we
 *      know that it will be correct.
 *
 *  c Another approach would be to order the cubes by
 *      "address" and use a hash table to find the cube
 *      corresponding to a pixel color.  I don't know how to
 *      do this with a variable length address, as each CTE
 *      will have 3*n bits, where n is the level.
 *
 *  d Another approach entirely is to put the CTE cubes into
 *      a tree, in such a way that starting from the root, and
 *      using 3 bits of address at a time, the correct branch of
 *      each octree can be taken until a leaf is found.  Because
 *      a given cube can be both a leaf and also have branches
 *      going to sub-cubes, the search stops only when no
 *      marked subcubes have addresses that match the given pixel.
 *
 *      In the tree method, we can start with a dense infrastructure,
 *      and place the leaves corresponding to the N colors
 *      in the tree, or we can grow from the root only those
 *      branches that end directly on leaves.
 *
 *  What we do here is to take approach d, and implement the tree
 *  "virtually", as a set of arrays, one array for each level
 *  of the tree.   Initially we start at level 5, an array with
 *  2^15 cubes, each with 8 subcubes.  We then build nodes at
 *  levels closer to the root; at level 4 there are 2^12 nodes
 *  each with 8 subcubes; etc.  Using these arrays has
 *  several advantages:
 *
 *     ~  We don't need to keep track of links between cubes
 *        and subcubes, because we can use the canonical
 *        addressing on the cell arrays directly to determine
 *        which nodes are parent cubes and which are sub-cubes.
 *
 *     ~  We can prune directly on this tree
 *
 *     ~  We can navigate the pruned tree quickly to classify
 *        each pixel in the image.
 *
 *  Canonical addressing guarantees that the i-th node at level k
 *  has 8 subnodes given by the 8*i ... 8*i+7 nodes at level k+1.
 *
 *  The pruning step works as follows.  We go from the lowest
 *  level up.  At each level, the threshold is found from the
 *  product of a factor near 1.0 and the ratio of unmarked pixels
 *  to remaining colors minus the 64.  We march through
 *  the space, sequentially considering a cube and its 8 subcubes.
 *  We first check those subcubes that are not already
 *  marked as CTE to see if any are above threshold, and if so,
 *  generate a CTE and mark them as such.
 *  We then determine if any of the subcubes have been marked.
 *  If so, and there are subcubes that are not marked,
 *  we generate a CTE for the cube from the remaining unmarked
 *  subcubes; this is mandatory and does not depend on how many
 *  pixels are in the set of subcubes.  If none of the subcubes
 *  are marked, we aggregate their pixels into the cube
 *  containing them, but do not mark it as a CTE; that
 *  will be determined when iterating through the next level up.
 *
 *  When all the pixels in a cube are accounted for in one or more
 *  colors, we set the boolean 'bleaf' to true.  This is the
 *  flag used to mark the cubes in the pruning step.  If a cube
 *  is marked, and all 8 subcubes are marked, then it is not
 *  itself given a CTE because all pixels have already been
 *  accounted for.
 *
 *  Note that the pruning of the tree and labelling of the CTEs
 *  step 2 accomplishes step 3 implicitly, because the marked
 *  and pruned tree is ready for use in labelling each pixel
 *  in step 4.  We now, for every pixel in the image, traverse
 *  the tree from the root, looking for the lowest cube that is a leaf.
 *  At each level we have a cube and subcube.  If we reach a subcube
 *  leaf that is marked 0, we know that the color is stored in the
 *  cube above, and we've found the CTE.  Otherwise, the subcube
 *  leaf is marked 1.  If we're at the last level, we've reached
 *  the final leaf and must use it.  Otherwise, continue the
 *  process at the next level down.
 *
 *  For robustness, efficiency and high quality output, we do the following:
 *
 *  (1) Measure the color content of the image.  If there is very little
 *      color, quantize in grayscale.
 *  (2) For efficiency, build the octree with a subsampled image if the
 *      image is larger than some threshold size.
 *  (3) Reserve an extra set of colors to prevent running out of colors
 *      when pruning the octree; specifically, during the assignment
 *      of those level 2 cells out of the 64 that have unassigned
 *      pixels.  The problem of running out is more likely to happen
 *      with small images, because the estimation we use for the
 *      number of pixels available is not accurate.
 *  (4) In the unlikely event that we run out of colors, the dithered
 *      image can be very poor.  As this would only happen with very
 *      small images, and dithering is not particularly noticeable with
 *      such images, turn it off.

 *                             for color quantization; typ. ~0.01, but smaller

 *                             significant fraction of gray
 * \return  pixd 8 bit with colormap, or NULL on error
 *
 * <pre>
 * Notes:
 *      (1) The parameters %validthresh and %colorthresh are used to
 *          determine if color quantization should be used on an image,
 *          or whether, instead, it should be quantized in grayscale.
 *          If the image has very few non-white and non-black pixels, or
 *          if those pixels that are non-white and non-black are all
 *          very close to either white or black, it is usually better
 *          to treat the color as accidental and to quantize the image
 *          to gray only.  These parameters are useful if you know
 *          something a priori about the image.  Perhaps you know that
 *          there is only a very small fraction of color pixels, but they're
 *          important to preserve; then you want to use a smaller value for
 *          these parameters.  To disable conversion to gray and force
 *          color quantization, use %validthresh = 0.0 and %colorthresh = 0.0.
 *      (2) See pixOctreeColorQuant() for algorithmic and implementation
 *          details.  This function has a more general interface.
 *      (3) See pixColorFraction() for computing the fraction of pixels
 *          that are neither white nor black, and the fraction of those
 *          pixels that have little color.  From the documentation there:
 *             If pixfract is very small, there are few pixels that are
 *             neither black nor white.  If colorfract is very small,
 *             the pixels that are neither black nor white have very
 *             little color content.  The product 'pixfract * colorfract'
 *             gives the fraction of pixels with significant color content.
 *          We test against the product %validthresh * %colorthresh
 *          to find color in images that have either very few
 *          intermediate gray pixels or that have many such gray pixels.

 * \param[in]    cqcaa        octree in array format

 *
 * <pre>
 * Notes:
 *      (1) This routine doesn't need to use the CTEs (colormap
 *          table entries) because the color indices are embedded
 *          in the octree.  Thus, the calling program must make
 *          and attach the colormap to pixd after it is returned.
 *      (2) Dithering is performed in integers, effectively rounding
 *          to 1/8 sample increment.  The data in the integer buffers is
 *          64 times the sample values.  The 'dif' is 8 times the
 *          sample values, and this spread, multiplied by 8, to the
 *          integer buffers.  Because the dif is truncated to an
 *          integer, the dither is accurate to 1/8 of a sample increment,
 *          or 1/2048 of the color range.

 *
 *  This may look a bit strange.  The notation 'r7' means the MSBit of
 *  the r value which has 8 bits, going down from r7 to r0.
 *  Keep in mind that r7 is actually the r component bit for level 1 of

 *  8 cubes, each labeled by the second most significant bits r6 g6 b6
 *  of the rgb color.

 * Notes:
 *      (1) We can consider all octcube indices to represent a
 *          specific point in color space: namely, the location
 *          of the 'upper-left' corner of the cube, where indices
 *          increase down and to the right.  The upper left corner
 *          of the color space is then 00000....
 *      (2) The 'rgbindex' is a 24-bit representation of the location,
 *          in octcube notation, at the center of the octcube.
 *          To get to the center of an octcube, you choose the 111
 *          octcube at the next lower level.
 *      (3) For example, if the octcube index = 110101 (binary),
 *          which is a level 2 expression, then the rgbindex
 *          is the 24-bit representation of 110101111 (at level 3);
 *          namely, 000110101111000000000000.  The number is padded
 *          with 3 leading 0s (because the representation uses
 *          only 21 bits) and 12 trailing 0s (the default for
 *          levels 4-7, which are contained within each of the level3
 *          octcubes.  Then the rgb values for the center of the
 *          octcube are: rval = 11100000, gval = 10100000, bval = 01100000

 * \param[in]    pixs         32 bpp rgb
 * \param[in]    level        significant bits for each of RGB; valid for {3,4}.
 *                            Use 0 for default (level 4; recommended
 * \param[in]    ditherflag   1 to dither, 0 otherwise
 * \return  pixd quantized to octcubes or NULL on error
 *
 * <pre>
 * Notes:
 *      (1) This color quantization method works very well without
 *          dithering, using octcubes at two different levels:
 *            (a) the input %level, which is either 3 or 4
 *            (b) level 2 (64 octcubes to cover the entire color space)
 *      (2) For best results, using %level = 4 is recommended.
 *          Why do we provide an option for using level 3?  Because
 *          there are 512 octcubes at level 3, and for many images
 *          not more than 256 are filled.  As a result, on some images
 *          a very accurate quantized representation is possible using
 *          %level = 3.
 *      (3) This first breaks up the color space into octcubes at the
 *          input %level, and computes, for each octcube, the average
 *          value of the pixels that are in it.
 *      (4) Then there are two possible situations:
 *            (a) If there are not more than 256 populated octcubes,
 *                it returns a cmapped pix with those values assigned.
 *            (b) Otherwise, it selects 192 octcubes containing the largest
 *                number of pixels and quantizes pixels within those octcubes
 *                to their average.  Then, to handle the residual pixels
 *                that are not in those 192 octcubes, it generates a
 *                level 2 octree consisting of 64 octcubes, and within
 *                each octcube it quantizes the residual pixels to their
 *                average within each of those level 2 octcubes.
 *      (5) Unpopulated level 2 octcubes are represented in the colormap
 *          by their centers.  This, of course, has no effect unless
 *          dithering is used for the output image.
 *      (6) The depth of pixd is the minimum required to support the
 *          number of colors found at %level; namely, 2, 4 or 8.
 *      (7) This function works particularly well on images such as maps,
 *          where there are a relatively small number of well-populated
 *          colors, but due to antialiasing and compression artifacts
 *          there may be a large number of different colors.  This will
 *          pull out and represent accurately the highly populated colors,
 *          while still making a reasonable approximation for the others.
 *      (8) The highest level of octcubes allowed is 4.  Use of higher
 *          levels typically results in having a small fraction of
 *          pixels in the most populated 192 octcubes.  As a result,
 *          most of the pixels are represented at level 2, which is
 *          not sufficiently accurate.
 *      (9) Dithering shows artifacts on some images.  If you plan to
 *          dither, pixOctreeColorQuant() and pixFixedOctcubeQuant256()
 *          usually give better results.

 * Notes:
 *      (1) This performs dithering to generate the colormap indices

 *          from RGB to colormap index.
 *      (2) For pixOctreeQuantByPopulation(), %indexmap maps from the
 *          standard octindex to colormap index (after subtracting 1).
 *          The basic pixel-level function, without dithering, is:
 *             extractRGBValues(lines[j], &rval, &gval, &bval);
 *             octindex = rtab[rval] | gtab[gval] | btab[bval];
 *             SET_DATA_BYTE(lined, j, indexmap[octindex] - 1);
 *      (3) This can be used in any situation where the general
 *          prescription for finding the colormap index from the rgb
 *          value is precisely this:
 *             cmapindex = indexmap[rtab[rval] | gtab[gval] | btab[bval]] - 1
 *          For example, in pixFixedOctcubeQuant256(), we don't use
 *          standard octcube indexing, the rtab (etc) LUTs map directly
 *          to the colormap index, and %indexmap just compensates for
 *          the 1-off indexing assumed to be in that table.

 * \brief   pixOctreeQuantNumColors()
 *
 * \param[in]    pixs        32 bpp rgb
 * \param[in]    maxcolors   8 to 256; the actual number of colors used
 *                           may be less than this
 * \param[in]    subsample   factor for computing color distribution;
 *                           use 0 for default
 * \return  pixd 4 or 8 bpp, colormapped, or NULL on error
 *
 * <pre>
 *  pixOctreeColorQuant is very flexible in terms of the relative
 *  depth of different cubes of the octree.   By contrast, this function,
 *  pixOctreeQuantNumColors is also adaptive, but it supports octcube
 *  leaves at only two depths: a smaller depth that guarantees
 *  full coverage of the color space and octcubes at one level
 *  deeper for more accurate colors.  Its main virutes are simplicity
 *  and speed, which are both derived from the natural indexing of
 *  the octcubes from the RGB values.
 *
 *  Before describing pixOctreeQuantNumColors, consider an even simpler
 *  approach for 4 bpp with either 8 or 16 colors.  With 8 colors,
 *  you simply go to level 1 octcubes and use the average color
 *  found in each cube.  For 16 colors, you find which of the three
 *  colors has the largest variance at the second level, and use two
 *  indices for that color.  The result is quite poor, because 1 some
 *  of the cubes are nearly empty and 2 you don't get much color
 *  differentiation for the extra 8 colors.  Trust me, this method may
 *  be simple, but it isn't worth anything.
 *
 *  In pixOctreeQuantNumColors, we generate colormapped images at
 *  either 4 bpp or 8 bpp.  For 4 bpp, we have a minimum of 8 colors
 *  for the level 1 octcubes, plus up to 8 additional colors that
 *  are determined from the level 2 popularity.  If the number of colors
 *  is between 8 and 16, the output is a 4 bpp image.  If the number of
 *  colors is greater than 16, the output is a 8 bpp image.
 *
 *  We use a priority queue, implemented with a heap, to select the
 *  requisite number of most populated octcubes at the deepest level
 *  level 2 for 64 or fewer colors; level 3 for more than 64 colors.
 *  These are combined with one color for each octcube one level above,
 *  which is used to span the color space of octcubes that were not
 *  included at the deeper level.
 *
 *  If the deepest level is 2, we combine the popular level 2 octcubes
 *  out of a total of 64 with the 8 level 1 octcubes.  If the deepest
 *  level is 3, we combine the popular level 3 octcubes out of a
 *  total 512 with the 64 level 2 octcubes that span the color space.
 *  In the latter case, we require a minimum of 64 colors for the level 2
 *  octcubes, plus up to 192 additional colors determined from level 3
 *  popularity.
 *
 *  The parameter 'maxlevel' is the deepest octcube level that is used.
 *  The implementation also uses two LUTs, which are employed in
 *  two successive traversals of the dest image.  The first maps
 *  from the src octindex at 'maxlevel' to the color table index,
 *  which is the value that is stored in the 4 or 8 bpp dest pixel.
 *  The second LUT maps from that colormap value in the dest to a
 *  new colormap value for a minimum sized colormap, stored back in
 *  the dest.  It is used to remove any color map entries that
 *  correspond to color space regions that have no pixels in the
 *  source image.  These regions can be either from the higher level
 *  e.g., level 1 for 4 bpp, or from octcubes at 'maxlevel' that
 *  are unoccupied.  This remapping results in the minimum number
 *  of colors used according to the constraints induced by the
 *  input 'maxcolors'.  We also compute the average R, G and B color
 *  values in each region of the color space represented by a
 *  colormap entry, and store them in the colormap.
 *
 *  The maximum number of colors is input, which determines the
 *  following properties of the dest image and octcube regions used:
 *
 *     Number of colors      dest image depth      maxlevel
 *     ----------------      ----------------      --------
 *       8 to 16                  4 bpp               2
 *       17 to 64                 8 bpp               2
 *       65 to 256                8 bpp               3
 *
 *  It may turn out that the number of extra colors, beyond the
 *  minimum 8 and 64 for maxlevel 2 and 3, respectively, is larger
 *  than the actual number of occupied cubes at these levels
 *  In that case, all the pixels are contained in this
 *  subset of cubes at maxlevel, and no colormap colors are needed
 *  to represent the remainder pixels one level above.  Thus, for
 *  example, in use one often finds that the pixels in an image
 *  occupy less than 192 octcubes at level 3, so they can be represented
 *  by a colormap for octcubes at level 3 only.

 * Notes:
 *      (1) Generates a colormapped image, where the colormap table values

 *          color content, and grayscale values for the rest.
 *      (2) The threshold (delta) is the maximum allowable difference of
 *          the max abs value of | r - g |, | r - b | and | g - b |.
 *      (3) The octcube values are the averages of all pixels that are
 *          found in the octcube, and that are far enough from gray to
 *          be considered color.  This can roughly be visualized as all
 *          the points in the rgb color cube that are not within a "cylinder"
 *          of diameter approximately 'delta' along the main diagonal.
 *      (4) We want to guarantee full coverage of the rgb color space; thus,
 *          if the output depth is 4, the octlevel is 1 (2 x 2 x 2 = 8 cubes)
 *          and if the output depth is 8, the octlevel is 2 (4 x 4 x 4
 *          = 64 cubes).
 *      (5) Consequently, we have the following constraint on the number
 *          of allowed gray levels: for 4 bpp, 8; for 8 bpp, 192.

 * \param[in]    ditherflag   1 for dithering; 0 for no dithering
 * \return  pixd 8 bit with colormap, or NULL on error
 *
 * <pre>
 * Notes:
 *  This simple 1-pass color quantization works by breaking the
 *  color space into 256 pieces, with 3 bits quantized for each of
 *  red and green, and 2 bits quantized for blue.  We shortchange
 *  blue because the eye is least sensitive to blue.  This
 *  division of the color space is into two levels of octrees,
 *  followed by a further division by 4 not 8, where both
 *  blue octrees have been combined in the third level.
 *
 *  The color map is generated from the 256 color centers by
 *  taking the representative color to be the center of the
 *  cell volume.  This gives a maximum error in the red and
 *  green values of 16 levels, and a maximum error in the
 *  blue sample of 32 levels.
 *
 *  Each pixel in the 24-bit color image is placed in its containing
 *  cell, given by the relevant MSbits of the red, green and blue
 *  samples.  An error-diffusion dithering is performed on each
 *  color sample to give the appearance of good average local color.
 *  Dithering is required; without it, the contouring and visible
 *  color errors are very bad.
 *
 *  I originally implemented this algorithm in two passes,
 *  where the first pass was used to compute the weighted average
 *  of each sample in each pre-allocated region of color space.
 *  The idea was to use these centroids in the dithering algorithm
 *  of the second pass, to reduce the average error that was
 *  being dithered.  However, with dithering, there is
 *  virtually no difference, so there is no reason to make the
 *  first pass.  Consequently, this 1-pass version just assigns
 *  the pixels to the centers of the pre-allocated cells.
 *  We use dithering to spread the difference between the sample
 *  value and the location of the center of the cell.  For speed
 *  and simplicity, we use integer dithering and propagate only
 *  to the right, down, and diagonally down-right, with ratios
 *  3/8, 3/8 and 1/4, respectively.  The results should be nearly
 *  as good, and a bit faster, with propagation only to the right
 *  and down.
 *
 *  The algorithm is very fast, because there is no search,
 *  only fast generation of the cell index for each pixel.
 *  We use a simple mapping from the three 8 bit rgb samples
 *  to the 8 bit cell index; namely, r7 r6 r5 g7 g6 g5 b7 b6.
 *  This is not in an octcube format, but it doesn't matter.
 *  There are no storage requirements.  We could keep a
 *  running average of the center of each sample in each
 *  cluster, rather than using the center of the cell, but
 *  this is just extra work, esp. with dithering.
 *
 *  This method gives surprisingly good results with dithering.
 *  However, without dithering, the loss of color accuracy is
 *  evident in regions that are very light or that have subtle
 *  blending of colors.

 *      (3) Often level 3 (512 octcubes) will succeed because not more

 *      (4) The depth of the result, which is either 2, 4 or 8 bpp,

 *      (5) This differs from pixFewColorsOctcubeQuant1(), which also

 *          that leaf.  This also requires precomputing the histogram
 *          of occupied octree leaves, which is generated using
 *          pixOctcubeHistogram().
 *      (6) This is used in pixConvertRGBToColormap() for images that
 *          are determined, by their histogram, to have relatively few
 *          colors.  This typically happens with orthographically
 *          produced images (as oppopsed to natural images), where
 *          it is expected that most of the pixels within a leaf

 * <pre>
 * Notes:
 *      (1) First runs pixFewColorsOctcubeQuant1().  If this succeeds,
 *          it separates the color from gray(ish) entries in the cmap,
 *          and re-quantizes the gray pixels.  The result has some pixels
 *          in color and others in gray.
 *      (2) This fails if there are more than 256 colors (i.e., more
 *          than 256 occupied octcubes in the color quantization).
 *      (3) Level 3 (512 octcubes) will usually succeed because not more
 *          than half of them are occupied with 1 or more pixels.
 *      (4) This uses the criterion from pixColorFraction() for deciding
 *          if a colormap entry is color; namely, if the color components
 *          are not too close to either black or white, and the maximum
 *          difference between component values equals or exceeds a threshold.
 *      (5) For quantizing the gray pixels, it uses a histogram-based
 *          method where input parameters determining the buckets are
 *          the minimum population fraction and the maximum allowed size.
 *      (6) Recommended input parameters are:
 *              %level:  3 or 4  (3 is default)
 *              %darkthresh:  20
 *              %lightthresh: 244
 *              %diffthresh: 20
 *              %minfract: 0.05
 *              %maxspan: 15
 *          These numbers are intended to be conservative (somewhat over-
 *          sensitive) in color detection,  It's usually better to pay
 *          extra with octcube quantization of a grayscale image than
 *          to use grayscale quantization on an image that has some

 * \return  pixd  2, 4 or 8 bpp, colormapped, or NULL on error
 *
 * <pre>
 * Notes:
 *      (1) In typical use, we are doing an operation, such as
 *          interpolative scaling, on a colormapped pix, where it is
 *          necessary to remove the colormap before the operation.
 *          We then want to re-quantize the RGB result using the same
 *          colormap.
 *      (2) The level is used to divide the color space into octcubes.
 *          Each input pixel is, in effect, placed at the center of an
 *          octcube at the given level, and it is mapped into the
 *          exact color (given in the colormap) that is the closest
 *          to that location.  We need to know that distance, for each color
 *          in the colormap.  The higher the level of the octtree, the smaller
 *          the octcubes in the color space, and hence the more accurately
 *          we can determine the closest color in the colormap; however,
 *          the size of the LUT, which is the total number of octcubes,
 *          increases by a factor of 8 for each increase of 1 level.
 *          The time required to acquire a level 4 mapping table, which has
 *          about 4K entries, is less than 1 msec, so that is the
 *          recommended minimum size to be used.  At that size, the
 *          octcubes have their centers 16 units apart in each (r,g,b)
 *          direction.  If two colors are in the same octcube, the one
 *          closest to the center will always be chosen.  The maximum
 *          error for any component occurs when the correct color is
 *          at a cube corner and there is an incorrect color just inside
 *          the cube next to the opposite corner, giving an error of
 *          14 units (out of 256) for each component.   Using a level 5
 *          mapping table reduces the maximum error to 6 units.
 *      (3) Typically you should use the Euclidean metric, because the
 *          resulting voronoi cells (which are generated using the actual
 *          colormap values as seeds) are convex for Euclidean distance
 *          but not for Manhattan distance.  In terms of the octcubes,
 *          convexity of the voronoi cells means that if the 8 corners
 *          of any cube (of which the octcubes are special cases)
 *          are all within a cell, then every point in the cube will
 *          lie within the cell.
 *      (4) The depth of the output pixd is equal to the maximum of
 *          (a) %mindepth and (b) the minimum (2, 4 or 8 bpp) necessary
 *          to hold the indices in the colormap.
 *      (5) We build a mapping table from octcube to colormap index so
 *          that this function can run in a time (otherwise) independent
 *          of the number of colors in the colormap.  This avoids a
 *          brute-force search for the closest colormap color to each
 *          pixel in the image.
 *      (6) This is similar to the function pixAssignToNearestColor()
 *          used for color segmentation.
 *      (7) Except for very small images or when using level > 4,
 *          it takes very little time to generate the tables,
 *          compared to the generation of the colormapped dest pix,
 *          so one would not typically use the low-level version.

 * \brief   pixcmapToOctcubeLUT()
 *
 * \param[in]    cmap
 * \param[in]    level    significant bits for each of RGB; valid in [1...6]
 * \param[in]    metric   L_MANHATTAN_DISTANCE, L_EUCLIDEAN_DISTANCE
 * \return  tab[2**3 * level]
 *
 * <pre>
 * Notes:
 *      (1) This function is used to quickly find the colormap color
 *          that is closest to any rgb color.  It is used to assign
 *          rgb colors to an existing colormap.  It can be very expensive
 *          to search through the entire colormap for the closest color
 *          to each pixel.  Instead, we first set up this table, which is
 *          populated by the colormap index nearest to each octcube
 *          color.  Then we go through the image; for each pixel,
 *          do two table lookups: first to generate the octcube index
 *          from rgb and second to use this table to read out the
 *          colormap index.
 *      (2) Do a slight modification for white and black.  For level = 4,
 *          each octcube size is 16.  The center of the whitest octcube
 *          is at (248, 248, 248), which is closer to 242 than 255.
 *          Consequently, any gray color between 242 and 254 will
 *          be selected, even if white (255, 255, 255) exists.  This is
 *          typically not optimal, because the original color was
 *          likely white.  Therefore, if white exists in the colormap,
 *          use it for any rgb color that falls into the most white octcube.
 *          Do the similar thing for black.
 *      (3) Here are the actual function calls for quantizing to a
 *          specified colormap:
 *            ~ first make the tables that map from rgb --> octcube index
 *                     makeRGBToIndexTables()
 *            ~ then for each pixel:
 *                * use the tables to get the octcube index
 *                     getOctcubeIndexFromRGB()
 *                * use this table to get the nearest color in the colormap
 *                     cmap_index = tab[index]
 *      (4) Distance can be either manhattan or euclidean.
 *      (5) In typical use, level = 4 gives reasonable results, and
 *          level = 5 is slightly better.  When this function is used
 *          for color segmentation, there are typically a small number
 *          of colors and the number of levels can be small (e.g., level = 3).

 *
 *   This provides a simple way to split an image into tiles
 *   and to perform operations independently on each tile.
 *
 *   The tile created with pixTilingGetTile() can have pixels in
 *   adjacent tiles for computation.  The number of extra pixels
 *   on each side of the tile is given by an 'overlap' parameter
 *   to pixTilingCreate().  For tiles at the boundary of
 *   the input image, quasi-overlap pixels are created by reflection
 *   symmetry into the tile.
 *
 *   Here's a typical intended usage.  Suppose you want to parallelize
 *   the operation on an image, by operating on tiles.  For each
 *   tile, you want to generate an in-place image result at the same
 *   resolution.  Suppose you choose a one-dimensional vertical tiling,
 *   where the desired tile width is 256 pixels and the overlap is
 *   30 pixels on left and right sides:
 *
 *     PIX *pixd = pixCreateTemplate(pixs);  // output
 *     PIXTILING  *pt = pixTilingCreate(pixs, 0, 1, 256, 30, 0);
 *     pixTilingGetCount(pt, &nx, NULL);
 *     for (j = 0; j < nx; j++) {
 *         PIX *pixt = pixTilingGetTile(pt, 0, j);
 *         SomeInPlaceOperation(pixt, 30, 0, ...);
 *         pixTilingPaintTile(pixd, 0, j, pixt, pt);
 *         pixDestroy(&pixt);
 *     }
 *
 *   In this example, note the following:
 *    ~ The unspecfified in-place operation could instead generate
 *      a new pix.  If this is done, the resulting pix must be the
 *      same size as pixt, because pixTilingPaintTile() makes that
 *      assumption, removing the overlap pixels before painting
 *      into the destination.
 *    ~ The 'overlap' parameters have been included in your function,
 *      to indicate which pixels are not in the exterior overlap region.
 *      You will need to change only pixels that are not in the overlap
 *      region, because those are the pixels that will be painted
 *      into the destination.
 *    ~ For tiles on the outside of the image, mirrored pixels are
 *      added to substitute for the overlap that is added to interior
 *      tiles.  This allows you to implement your function without
 *      reference to which tile it is; no special coding is necessary
 *      for pixels that are near the image boundary.
 *    ~ The tiles are labeled by (i, j) = (row, column),
 *      and in this example there is one row and nx columns.

 * \param[in]    pixs  pix to be tiled; any depth; colormap OK

 *
 * <pre>
 * Notes:
 *      (1) We put a clone of pixs in the PixTiling.
 *      (2) The input to pixTilingCreate() for horizontal tiling can be
 *          either the number of tiles across the image or the approximate
 *          width of the tiles.  If the latter, the actual width will be
 *          determined by making all tiles but the last of equal width, and
 *          making the last as close to the others as possible.  The same
 *          consideration is applied independently to the vertical tiling.
 *          To specify tile width, set nx = 0; to specify the number of
 *          tiles horizontally across the image, set w = 0.
 *      (3) If pixs is to be tiled in one-dimensional strips, use ny = 1 for
 *          vertical strips and nx = 1 for horizontal strips.
 *      (4) The overlap must not be larger than the width or height of
 *          the leftmost or topmost tile(s).

 *
 *      One can define a coordinate space by the location of the origin,
 *      the orientation of x and y axes, and the unit scaling along
 *      each axis.  An affine transform is a general linear
 *      transformation from one coordinate space to another.
 *
 *      For the general case, we can define the affine transform using
 *      two sets of three (noncollinear) points in a plane.  One set
 *      corresponds to the input (src) coordinate space; the other to the
 *      transformed (dest) coordinate space.  Each point in the
 *      src corresponds to one of the points in the dest.  With two
 *      sets of three points, we get a set of 6 equations in 6 unknowns
 *      that specifies the mapping between the coordinate spaces.
 *      The interface here allows you to specify either the corresponding
 *      sets of 3 points, or the transform itself (as a vector of 6
 *      coefficients).
 *
 *      Given the transform as a vector of 6 coefficients, we can compute
 *      both a a pointwise affine coordinate transformation and an
 *      affine image transformation.
 *
 *      To compute the coordinate transform, we need the coordinate
 *      value (x',y') in the transformed space for any point (x,y)
 *      in the original space.  To derive this transform from the
 *      three corresponding points, it is convenient to express the affine
 *      coordinate transformation using an LU decomposition of
 *      a set of six linear equations that express the six coordinates
 *      of the three points in the transformed space as a function of
 *      the six coordinates in the original space.  Once we have
 *      this transform matrix , we can transform an image by
 *      finding, for each destination pixel, the pixel (or pixels)
 *      in the source that give rise to it.
 *
 *      This 'pointwise' transformation can be done either by sampling
 *      and picking a single pixel in the src to replicate into the dest,
 *      or by interpolating (or averaging) over four src pixels to
 *      determine the value of the dest pixel.  The first method is
 *      implemented by pixAffineSampled() and the second method by
 *      pixAffine().  The interpolated method can only be used for
 *      images with more than 1 bpp, but for these, the image quality
 *      is significantly better than the sampled method, due to
 *      the 'antialiasing' effect of weighting the src pixels.
 *
 *      Interpolation works well when there is relatively little scaling,
 *      or if there is image expansion in general.  However, if there
 *      is significant image reduction, one should apply a low-pass
 *      filter before subsampling to avoid aliasing the high frequencies.
 *
 *      A typical application might be to align two images, which
 *      may be scaled, rotated and translated versions of each other.
 *      Through some pre-processing, three corresponding points are
 *      located in each of the two images.  One of the images is
 *      then to be (affine) transformed to align with the other.
 *      As mentioned, the standard way to do this is to use three
 *      sets of points, compute the 6 transformation coefficients
 *      from these points that describe the linear transformation,
 *
 *          x' = ax + by + c
 *          y' = dx + ey + f
 *
 *      and use this in a pointwise manner to transform the image.
 *
 *      N.B.  Be sure to see the comment in getAffineXformCoeffs(),
 *      regarding using the inverse of the affine transform for points
 *      to transform images.
 *
 *      There is another way to do this transformation; namely,
 *      by doing a sequence of simple affine transforms, without
 *      computing directly the affine coordinate transformation.
 *      We have at our disposal (1) translations (using rasterop),
 *      (2) horizontal and vertical shear about any horizontal and vertical
 *      line, respectively, and (3) non-isotropic scaling by two
 *      arbitrary x and y scaling factors.  We also have rotation
 *      about an arbitrary point, but this is equivalent to a set
 *      of three shears so we do not need to use it.
 *
 *      Why might we do this?  For binary images, it is usually
 *      more efficient to do such transformations by a sequence
 *      of word parallel operations.  Shear and translation can be
 *      done in-place and word parallel; arbitrary scaling is
 *      mostly pixel-wise.
 *
 *      Suppose that we are transforming image 1 to correspond to image 2.
 *      We have a set of three points, describing the coordinate space
 *      embedded in image 1, and we need to transform image 1 until
 *      those three points exactly correspond to the new coordinate space
 *      defined by the second set of three points.  In our image
 *      matching application, the latter set of three points was
 *      found to be the corresponding points in image 2.
 *
 *      The most elegant way I can think of to do such a sequential
 *      implementation is to imagine that we're going to transform
 *      BOTH images until they're aligned.  (We don't really want
 *      to transform both, because in fact we may only have one image
 *      that is undergoing a general affine transformation.)
 *
 *      Choose the 3 corresponding points as follows:
 *         ~ The 1st point is an origin
 *         ~ The 2nd point gives the orientation and scaling of the
 *           "x" axis with respect to the origin
 *         ~ The 3rd point does likewise for the "y" axis.
 *      These "axes" must not be collinear; otherwise they are
 *      arbitrary (although some strange things will happen if
 *      the handedness sweeping through the minimum angle between
 *      the axes is opposite).
 *
 *      An important constraint is that we have shear operations
 *      about an arbitrary horizontal or vertical line, but always
 *      parallel to the x or y axis.  If we continue to pretend that
 *      we have an unprimed coordinate space embedded in image 1 and
 *      a primed coordinate space embedded in image 2, we imagine
 *      (a) transforming image 1 by horizontal and vertical shears about
 *      point 1 to align points 3 and 2 along the y and x axes,
 *      respectively, and (b) transforming image 2 by horizontal and
 *      vertical shears about point 1' to align points 3' and 2' along
 *      the y and x axes.  Then we scale image 1 so that the distances
 *      from 1 to 2 and from 1 to 3 are equal to the distances in
 *      image 2 from 1' to 2' and from 1' to 3'.  This scaling operation
 *      leaves the true image origin, at (0,0) invariant, and will in
 *      general translate point 1.  The original points 1 and 1' will
 *      typically not coincide in any event, so we must translate
 *      the origin of image 1, at its current point 1, to the origin
 *      of image 2 at 1'.  The images should now be aligned.  But
 *      because we never really transformed image 2 (and image 2 may
 *      not even exist), we now perform  on image 1 the reverse of
 *      the shear transforms that we imagined doing on image 2;
 *      namely, the negative vertical shear followed by the negative
 *      horizontal shear.  Image 1 should now have its transformed
 *      unprimed coordinates aligned with the original primed
 *      coordinates.  In all this, it is only necessary to keep track
 *      of the shear angles and translations of points during the shears.
 *      What has been accomplished is a general affine transformation
 *      on image 1.
 *
 *      Having described all this, if you are going to use an
 *      affine transformation in an application, this is what you
 *      need to know:
 *
 *          (1) You should NEVER use the sequential method, because
 *              the image quality for 1 bpp text is much poorer
 *              (even though it is about 2x faster than the pointwise sampled
 *              method), and for images with depth greater than 1, it is
 *              nearly 20x slower than the pointwise sampled method
 *              and over 10x slower than the pointwise interpolated method!
 *              The sequential method is given here for purely
 *              pedagogical reasons.
 *
 *          (2) For 1 bpp images, use the pointwise sampled function
 *              pixAffineSampled().  For all other images, the best
 *              quality results result from using the pointwise
 *              interpolated function pixAffinePta() or pixAffine();
 *              the cost is less than a doubling of the computation time
 *              with respect to the sampled function.  If you use
 *              interpolation on colormapped images, the colormap will
 *              be removed, resulting in either a grayscale or color
 *              image, depending on the values in the colormap.
 *              If you want to retain the colormap, use pixAffineSampled().
 *
 *      Typical relative timing of pointwise transforms (sampled = 1.0):
 *      8 bpp:   sampled        1.0
 *               interpolated   1.6
 *      32 bpp:  sampled        1.0
 *               interpolated   1.8
 *      Additionally, the computation time/pixel is nearly the same
 *      for 8 bpp and 32 bpp, for both sampled and interpolated.

 * \return  pixd, or NULL on error
 *
 * <pre>
 * Notes:
 *      (1) The alpha channel is transformed separately from pixs,
 *          and aligns with it, being fully transparent outside the
 *          boundary of the transformed pixs.  For pixels that are fully
 *          transparent, a blending function like pixBlendWithGrayMask()
 *          will give zero weight to corresponding pixels in pixs.
 *      (2) If pixg is NULL, it is generated as an alpha layer that is
 *          partially opaque, using %fract.  Otherwise, it is cropped
 *          to pixs if required and %fract is ignored.  The alpha channel
 *          in pixs is never used.
 *      (3) Colormaps are removed.
 *      (4) When pixs is transformed, it doesn't matter what color is brought
 *          in because the alpha channel will be transparent (0) there.
 *      (5) To avoid losing source pixels in the destination, it may be
 *          necessary to add a border to the source pix before doing
 *          the affine transformation.  This can be any non-negative number.
 *      (6) The input %ptad and %ptas are in a coordinate space before
 *          the border is added.  Internally, we compensate for this
 *          before doing the affine transform on the image after the border
 *          is added.
 *      (7) The default setting for the border values in the alpha channel
 *          is 0 (transparent) for the outermost ring of pixels and
 *          (0.5 * fract * 255) for the second ring.  When blended over
 *          a second image, this
 *          (a) shrinks the visible image to make a clean overlap edge
 *              with an image below, and
 *          (b) softens the edges by weakening the aliasing there.
 *          Use l_setAlphaMaskBorder() to change these values.

 * <pre>
 *  We have a set of six equations, describing the affine
 *  transformation that takes 3 points ptas into 3 other
 *  points ptad.  These equations are:
 *
 *          x1' = c[0]*x1 + c[1]*y1 + c[2]
 *          y1' = c[3]*x1 + c[4]*y1 + c[5]

 *          y2' = c[3]*x2 + c[4]*y2 + c[5]
 *          x3' = c[0]*x3 + c[1]*y3 + c[2]
 *          y3' = c[3]*x3 + c[4]*y3 + c[5]
 *
 *  This can be represented as
 *
 *          AC = B
 *
 *  where B and C are column vectors
 *
 *          B = [ x1' y1' x2' y2' x3' y3' ]
 *          C = [ c[0] c[1] c[2] c[3] c[4] c[5] c[6] ]
 *
 *  and A is the 6x6 matrix
 *
 *          x1   y1   1   0    0    0
 *           0    0   0   x1   y1   1
 *          x2   y2   1   0    0    0
 *           0    0   0   x2   y2   1

 *           0    0   0   x3   y3   1
 *
 *  These six equations are solved here for the coefficients C.
 *
 *  These six coefficients can then be used to find the dest
 *  point x',y') corresponding to any src point (x,y, according
 *  to the equations
 *
 *           x' = c[0]x + c[1]y + c[2]
 *           y' = c[3]x + c[4]y + c[5]
 *
 *  that are implemented in affineXformPt.
 *
 *  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Very important   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 *
 *  When the affine transform is composed from a set of simple
 *  operations such as translation, scaling and rotation,
 *  it is built in a form to convert from the un-transformed src
 *  point to the transformed dest point.  However, when an
 *  affine transform is used on images, it is used in an inverted
 *  way: it converts from the transformed dest point to the
 *  un-transformed src point.  So, for example, if you transform
 *  a boxa using transform A, to transform an image in the same
 *  way you must use the inverse of A.
 *
 *  For example, if you transform a boxa with a 3x3 affine matrix
 *  'mat', the analogous image transformation must use 'matinv':
 * \code
 *     boxad = boxaAffineTransform(boxas, mat);
 *     affineInvertXform(mat, &matinv);
 *     pixd = pixAffine(pixs, matinv, L_BRING_IN_WHITE);
 * \endcode

 *
 * <pre>
 * Notes:
 *      (1) The 6 affine transform coefficients are the first
 *          two rows of a 3x3 matrix where the last row has
 *          only a 1 in the third column.  We invert this
 *          using gaussjordan(), and select the first 2 rows
 *          as the coefficients of the inverse affine transform.
 *      (2) Alternatively, we can find the inverse transform
 *          coefficients by inverting the 2x2 submatrix,
 *          and treating the top 2 coefficients in the 3rd column as
 *          a RHS vector for that 2x2 submatrix.  Then the
 *          6 inverted transform coefficients are composed of
 *          the inverted 2x2 submatrix and the negative of the
 *          transformed RHS vector.  Why is this so?  We have
 *             Y = AX + R  (2 equations in 6 unknowns)
 *          Then
 *             X = A'Y - A'R
 *          Gauss-jordan solves
 *             AF = R
 *          and puts the solution for F, which is A'R,
 *          into the input R vector.

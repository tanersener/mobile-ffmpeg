 *
 *      This file contains functions that generate hit-miss Sels
 *      for doing a loose match to a small bitmap.  The hit-miss
 *      Sel is made from a given bitmap.  Several "knobs"
 *      are available to control the looseness of the match.
 *      In general, a tight match will have fewer false positives
 *      (bad matches) but more false negatives (missed patterns).
 *      The values to be used depend on the quality and variation
 *      of the image in which the pattern is to be searched,
 *      and the relative penalties of false positives and
 *      false negatives.  Default values for the three knobs --
 *      minimum distance to boundary pixels, number of extra pixels
 *      added to selected sides, and minimum acceptable runlength
 *      in eroded version -- are provided.
 *
 *      The generated hit-miss Sels can always be used in the
 *      rasterop implementation of binary morphology (in morph.h).
 *      If they are small enough (not more than 31 pixels extending
 *      in any direction from the Sel origin), they can also be used
 *      to auto-generate dwa code (fmorphauto.c).

 * \param[in]    nhlines number of hor lines along which elements are found
 * \param[in]    nvlines number of vert lines along which elements are found
 * \param[in]    distance min distance from boundary pixel; use 0 for default
 * \param[in]    minlength min runlength to set hit or miss; use 0 for default
 * \param[in]    toppix number of extra pixels of bg added above
 * \param[in]    botpix number of extra pixels of bg added below
 * \param[in]    leftpix number of extra pixels of bg added to left
 * \param[in]    rightpix number of extra pixels of bg added to right
 * \param[out]   ppixe [optional] input pix expanded by extra pixels
 * \return  sel hit-miss for input pattern, or NULL on error
 *
 * <pre>
 * Notes:
 *    (1) The horizontal and vertical lines along which elements are
 *        selected are roughly equally spaced.  The actual locations of
 *        the hits and misses are the centers of respective run-lengths.
 *    (2) No elements are selected that are less than 'distance' pixels away
 *        from a boundary pixel of the same color.  This makes the
 *        match much more robust to edge noise.  Valid inputs of
 *        'distance' are 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.  If distance is either 0 or
 *        greater than 4, we reset it to the default value.
 *    (3) The 4 numbers for adding rectangles of pixels outside the fg
 *        can be use if the pattern is expected to be surrounded by bg
 *        (white) pixels.  On the other hand, if the pattern may be near
 *        other fg (black) components on some sides, use 0 for those sides.
 *    (4) The pixels added to a side allow you to have miss elements there.
 *        There is a constraint between distance, minlength, and
 *        the added pixels for this to work.  We illustrate using the
 *        default values.  If you add 5 pixels to the top, and use a
 *        distance of 1, then you end up with a vertical run of at least
 *        4 bg pixels along the top edge of the image.  If you use a
 *        minimum runlength of 3, each vertical line will always find
 *        a miss near the center of its run.  However, if you use a
 *        minimum runlength of 5, you will not get a miss on every vertical
 *        line.  As another example, if you have 7 added pixels and a
 *        distance of 2, you can use a runlength up to 5 to guarantee
 *        that the miss element is recorded.  We give a warning if the
 *        contraint does not guarantee a miss element outside the
 *        image proper.
 *    (5) The input pix, as extended by the extra pixels on selected sides,
 *        can optionally be returned.  For debugging, call
 *        pixDisplayHitMissSel() to visualize the hit-miss sel superimposed
 *        on the generating bitmap.

 *
 * <pre>
 * Notes:
 *    (1) All fg elements selected are exactly hitdist pixels away from
 *        the nearest fg boundary pixel, and ditto for bg elements.
 *        Valid inputs of hitdist and missdist are 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.
 *        For example, a hitdist of 0 puts the hits at the fg boundary.
 *        Usually, the distances should be > 0 avoid the effect of
 *        noise at the boundary.
 *    (2) Set hitskip < 0 if no hits are to be used.  Ditto for missskip.
 *        If both hitskip and missskip are < 0, the sel would be empty,
 *        and NULL is returned.
 *    (3) The 4 flags determine whether the sel is increased on that side
 *        to allow bg misses to be placed all along that boundary.
 *        The increase in sel size on that side is the minimum necessary
 *        to allow the misses to be placed at mindist.  For text characters,
 *        the topflag and botflag are typically set to 1, and the leftflag
 *        and rightflag to 0.
 *    (4) The input pix, as extended by the extra pixels on selected sides,
 *        can optionally be returned.  For debugging, call
 *        pixDisplayHitMissSel() to visualize the hit-miss sel superimposed
 *        on the generating bitmap.
 *    (5) This is probably the best of the three sel generators, in the
 *        sense that you have the most flexibility with the smallest number
 *        of hits and misses.

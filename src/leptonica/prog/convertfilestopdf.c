/*
 * convertfilestopdf.c
 *
 *    Converts all image files in the given directory with matching substring
 *    to a pdf, with the specified scaling factor <= 1.0 applied to all
 *    images.
 *
 *    See below for syntax and usage.
 *
 *    The images are displayed at a resolution that depends on the
 *    input resolution (res) and the scaling factor (scalefact) that
 *    is applied to the images before conversion to pdf.  Internally
 *    we multiply these, so that the generated pdf will render at the
 *    same resolution as if it hadn't been scaled.  By downscaling, you
 *    reduce the size of the images.  For jpeg, downscaling reduces
 *    pdf size by the square of the scale factor.  The jpeg quality can
 *    be specified from 1 (very poor) to 100 (best available, but
 *    still lossy); use 0 for the default (75).

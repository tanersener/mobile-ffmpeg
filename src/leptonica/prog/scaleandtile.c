/*
 * scaleandtile.c
 *
 *    Generates a single image tiling of all images in a directory
 *    whose filename contains a given substring.  The filenames
 *    are filtered and sorted, and read into a pixa, which is
 *    then tiled into a pix at a specified depth, and finally
 *    written out to file.
 *
 *    Input:  dirin:  directory that has image files
 *            depth (output depth: 1, 8 or 32; use 32 for RGB)
 *            width (of each tile; all pix are scaled to the same width)
 *            ncols (number of tiles in each row)
 *            background (0 for white, 1 for black)
 *            fileout:  output tiled image file
 *
 *    Note: this program is Unix only; it will not compile under cygwin.

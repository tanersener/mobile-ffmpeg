/*
 * displayboxa.c
 *
 *        displayboxa filein first last width fileout
 *
 *   This reads a boxa from file and generates a composite view of the
 *   boxes, one per "page", tiled in rows.
 *   Set last == -1 to go to the end.
 *   The pix that backs each box is chosen to be the minimum size that
 *   supports every box in the boxa.  Each pix (and the box it backs)
 *   is scaled so that the pix width is @width in pixels.
 *   The number of each box is written below the box.
 *
 *   The minimum allowed width of the backing pix is 30, and the default
 *   width is 100.

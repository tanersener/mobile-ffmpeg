/*
 *  autogentest1.c
 *
 *  This makes /tmp/lept/auto/autogen.137.c and /tmp/lept/auto/autogen.137.h.
 *  It shows how to use the stringcode facility.
 *
 *  In general use, you compile and run the code generator before
 *  compiling and running the generated code, in autogentest2.c.
 *
 *  But here, because we compile both autogentest1.c and autogentest2.c
 *  at the same time, it is necessary to put the generated code
 *  in this directory.  Running autogentest1 will simply regenerate
 *  this code, but in the /tmp/lept/auto/ directory.
 *
 *  As part of the test, this makes /tmp/lept/auto/autogen.138.c and
 *  /tmp/lept/auto/autogen.138.h, which contain the same data, using
 *  the function strcodeCreateFromFile().  With this method, you do not
 *  need to specify the file type (e.g., "PIXA")

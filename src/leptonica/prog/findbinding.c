/*
 * findbinding.c
 *
 *    Here is a simple approach to find the location of the binding
 *    in an open book that is photographed.  It relies on the typical
 *    condition that the background pixels near the binding are
 *    darker than those on the rest of the page, and further, that
 *    the lightest pixels in each column parallel to the binding
 *    exhibit a large variance by column near the binding.  This is
 *    because the pixels at the binding are typically even darker
 *    than the pixels near the binding.
 *
 *    Accurate results are obtained in this example at the very low
 *    resolution of 45 ppi.  Better results can be expected at higher
 *    resolution.

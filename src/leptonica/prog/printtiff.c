/*
 * printtiff.c
 *
 *   Syntax:  printtiff filein [printer]
 *
 *   Prints a multipage tiff file of 1 bpp images to a printer.
 *   If the tiff is at standard fax resolution, it expands the
 *   vertical size by a factor of two before encapsulating in
 *   ccittg4 encoded PostScript.  The PostScript file is left in /tmp,
 *   and erased (deleted, removed, unlinked) on the next invocation.
 *
 *   If the printer is not specified, this just writes the PostScript
 *   file /tmp/print_tiff.ps.
 *
 *   If your system does not have lpr, it likely has lp.  You can run
 *   printtiff to make the PostScript file, and then print with lp:
 *       lp -d <printer> /tmp/print_tiff.ps
 *       lp -d <printer> -o ColorModel=Color /tmp/print_tiff.ps
 *   etc.
 *
 *   ***************************************************************
 *   N.B.  If a printer is specified, this program invokes lpr via
 *         "system'.  It could pose a security vulnerability if used
 *         as a service in a production environment.  Consequently,
 *         this program should only be used for debug and testing.
 *   ***************************************************************

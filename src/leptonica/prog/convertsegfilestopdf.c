/*
 * convertsegfilestopdf.c
 *
 *    Converts all image files in the page directory with matching substring
 *    to a pdf.  Image regions are downscaled by the scalefactor and
 *    encoded as jpeg.  Non-image regions with depth > 1 are automatically
 *    scaled up by 2x and thresholded if the encoding type is G4;
 *    otherwise, no scaling is performed on them.  To convert all
 *    files in the page directory, use 'allfiles' for its substring.
 *    Likewise to use all files in the mask directory, use 'allfiles'
 *    for its substring.
 *
 *    A typical invocation would be something like:
 *       convertsegfilestopdf /tmp/segpages allfiles /tmp/segmasks allfiles \
 *       300 2 160 skip 0.5 [title] [output pdf]
 *    This upscales by 2x all non-image regions to 600 ppi, and downscales
 *    by 0.5 all image regions to 150 ppi.
 *
 *    If used on a set of images without segmentation data, a typical
 *    invocation would be:
 *       convertsegfilestopdf /tmp/pages allfiles skip skip \
 *       300 2 160 skip 1.0 [title] [output pdf]
 *    If the page images have depth > 1 bpp, this will upscale all pages
 *    by 2x (to 600 ppi), and then convert the images to 1 bpp.
 *    Note that 'skip' is used three times to omit all segmentation data.
 *
 *    See below for further syntax and usage.
 *
 *    Again, note that the image regions are displayed at a resolution
 *    that depends on the input resolution (res) and the scaling factor
 *    (scalefact) that is applied to the images before conversion to pdf.
 *    Internally we multiply these, so that the generated pdf will render
 *    at the same resolution as if it hadn't been scaled.  When we
 *    downscale the image regions, this:
 *       (1) reduces the size of the images.  For jpeg, downscaling
 *           reduces by square of the scale factor the 'image' segmented part.
 *       (2) regenerates the jpeg with quality = 75 after downscaling.
 *
 *    If you already have a boxaafile of the image regions, use 'skip' for
 *    maskdir.  Otherwise, this will generate the boxaa from the mask images.
 *
 *    A regression test that uses this is pdfseg_reg, which
 *    generates images and the boxaa file in /tmp/segtest/.
